The \"Tiger Mom\"--highly controlling, strict, severe almost to the point of abuse--has become the go-to phrase for many Americans when referring to traditional East Asian mothering styles. This attempt to categorize and simplify cultural differences fails to capture the complex nature of East Asian mothering. While the American public imagines East Asian parenting as only unwavering and harsh, immigrant parents, for example, must often find a parenting strategy that bridges traditional East Asian and mainstream American norms. This course will explore the ways that contemporary Asian American authors depict the complexity of East Asian mothering and mothers. What kinds of mothering does the reductive category of Tiger Mom ignore? What are the central questions these authors pose about mothers and motherhood? How do they negotiate the tension between the individual versus the community, or the pursuit of the child's own interests as opposed to success as defined by the parent when it comes to that child's future? And what are the pitfalls of reading literature as social science? In keeping with tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the instructor once a week; during these meetings, one student will present a short analytical paper on the texts covered that week. The other student will write a response paper and join the instructor in a discussion of both papers.

He is also arguably the most prominent and influential Muslim in the history of the United States. His story and legacy powerfully illustrate the complex intersections of Muslim identity, political resistance, and national belonging. From the early period of \"Black Muslim\" movements represented by Malcolm X, to the current \"War on Terror\" era, American Muslims have faced a complex intersection of exclusions and marginalization, in relation to national belonging, race, and religion. Taking Malcolm X as our point of departure, this course examines how American Muslims have navigated these multiple layers of marginalization. We will therefore consider how the broader socio-political contexts that Muslims are a part of shape their visions of Islam, and how they contest these competing visions among themselves. In so doing, we will examine the complex relation between religion, race, and politics in the United States.\nThroughout the course, we will be engaging with historical and anthropological material, autobiographies, documentaries, films, historical primary-source documents, music, and social media materials. The course fosters critical thinking about diversity by challenging assumptions of who Muslims are, what being American means, and what Islam is. It also focuses on the complex interaction of different dimensions of diversity, from religion to ideology, race, nationality, ethnicity, culture, gender, and language.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and concentrators in REL, AFR, and AMST","crossListing":["AAS 237","AFR 237","AMST 237","REL 237"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022345","department":"AAS","number":253,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1222,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Embodied Knowledges: Latinx, Asian American, And Black American Writing On Invisible Disability","titleShort":"Embodied Knowledges","instructors":[{"id":2590,"name":"Maria Elena Cepeda"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"11:20","end":"12:35","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Two 5-6 page essays; One group question assignment; Final reflection document","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This interdisciplinary course assumes an expansive approach towards disability, defining it not exclusively as a legible identity that one can lay claim to, but rather as an identity grounded in one's relationship to power (Kim and Schalk, 2020). This course centers on the critical role of lived experience as a key site of everyday theorization for the multiply marginalized, and specifically on the ways in which invisibly disabled Latinx, Asian American, and Black American individuals write the self. As scholars in disability studies argue, self-representations of disabled individuals carry the potential for us as a society to move beyond the binary narratives of \"tragedy or inspiration\" so often associated with disability. Rather, the self-produced narratives of US disabled writers of color offer a much more nuanced portrayal of everyday life with disability/ies for the multiply marginalized. Much like invisible disability itself, these self-representations ultimately refute traditional depictions of disability, and underscore the ways in which the bodymind serves as a rich, albeit often overlooked, site of knowledge.\nEmbodied Knowledges draws on the insights of disability studies, crip studies, anthropology, literary studies, medicine, psychology, education, cultural studies, ethnic studies, American studies, gender and sexuality studies, sociology, and trauma studies. We will examine the works of Latinx, Asian American, and Black American writers and scholars others in relationship to one another, and as points of departure for examining issues such as the relationship between immigration and disability; intergenerational trauma; the impacts of paradigms such as the Model Minority Myth and notions of cultural deficit; passing; the politics of disability disclosure, the paradoxes of invisible disability; invisible disability in academic spaces; the role of culture and categories of difference such as race, gender, class and immigration status in societal approaches to and understandings of invisible disability; and future visions in the realm of disability justice and care work.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference given to majors or concentrators in LATS, AMST, and AAST, in order of seniority.","crossListing":["AAS 253","AMST 253","LATS 254"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022344","department":"AAS","number":275,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3342,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Acting Out: Performativity, Production, And Politics In East Asian Theatres","titleShort":"East Asian Theatres","instructors":[{"id":0,"name":"Man He"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Evaluation will be based on 1) ACTIVE in-class discussion; 2) three short papers (3 pages each); 3) a take-home midterm; and 4) participation in a final in-class theatre production.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None; open to all.

Although Asian theatres have been studied systematically in the West for at least a century, the West has never truly left its \"othering\" look at them. Yet, what is \"different\" for the West is bedrock for Asian cultures. Theatre, one of the most important and dynamic forms of cultural production and communication, has actively involved all strata of Asian societies for a millennium. How to explain theatre's continued presence and relevance for Asian nations? What do the traditions of Kun, Noh, and Talchum reveal about the cultures and communities in which they were created? This course seeks to understand from the Asian perspective, rather than \"exoticize\" and \"other,\" musical and dance theatres from China, Japan, and Korea. Examining the evolving presentations of signature dramas dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, we will act out Asian theatres in the following ways: (1) by reading the original plays in translation in tandem with their contemporary and intercultural reproductions, we will explore how Asian theatres fare in the era of globalization within and beyond national borders; (2) by revealing the \"technologies\" of writing, reading, acting, and staging these plays in different cultural milieus, we will consider what kinds of language and rhetoric, forms of music and movement, as well as visual components are deployed to convey evolving messages; (3) by considering key performances held outside of the proscenium stage, we will gain exposure to alternative theatrical spaces in Asian and diasporic communities that reform performing conventions, reconfigure staging environments, and renegotiate cultural values. In this manner, we will together gain an appreciation for the aesthetic devices, thematic concerns, and production politics of East Asian theatres and their global reproductions. Class materials include drama, production videos, and invited zoom sessions with Asian theatre practitioners and directors who live in the U.S. and other diasporic communities.

We will also explore how BIPOC artists, architects, writers, and scholars engage architecture as a standpoint of critique, pushing back against the racialization of architecture and offer alternative or new ways of thinking about structures and space.

In this tutorial, we will examine racism in public health policy, practice and research through an investigation of several mediums of evidence and information, ranging from peer reviewed literature to news editorials, podcasts and documentaries. We will explore specific pathways by which legacies of colonialism and racism function in various public health disciplines such as epidemiology, social \u0026 behavioral sciences, health policy and environmental health while also examining the dynamics of power and history in research and community practice.

We will begin by covering the history of Black women in television. This historical approach will then lead us to examine selected TV episodes, and investigate social media pages of Black actresses, television producers, and the fans of these shows.

Through movement and rhythm, dancers experience the embodied knowledge of previous generations, while connecting to contemporary cultural, political, and economic realities. Katherine Dunham devoted her life to exploring and exposing the multiple layers and complexities of the African diasporic experience through her ethnographic dance choreographies, her dance technique, her schools, her music, and her writing. Dunham's work as a dance anthropologist, artist, educator, and humanitarian is manifested in Dunham Technique; the technique is a fusion of African diasporic dance, ballet and modern dance, and functions as an embodied medium for cultural communication. The technique is considered \"a way of life\" as it uses theory and philosophy to engage participants in a holistic experience that is not only physical, but also intellectual, emotional, and spiritual. Through this combination of physicality, history, theory, and philosophy, Dunham Technique is a tool to understand one's inner self and place oneself within a historical and cultural framework. In this course, students will explore the history, theory, and philosophies of Dunham Technique and Katherine Dunham, while actively participating with the technique's movement concepts and vocabulary. Students will engage in the fundamentals of a Dunham Technique movement class through center floor work, barre exercises, progressions, and choreography. The course will combine the studio experience of the physical technique with lectures and discussions. Students will learn about the three theories of Dunham Technique (Form and Function, Intercultural Communication, and Socialization through the Arts) and its three philosophies (Self-Examination, Detachment, and Discrimination) while also learning the history and historical context of the technique and its creator.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in expanding their knowledge of African diasporic dance and Dunham Technique.","crossListing":["DANC 111","AFR 111"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019563","department":"AFR","number":113,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1064,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Musics Of Africa","titleShort":"Musics Of Africa","instructors":[{"id":3024,"name":"Corinna S.

Numbers can be used to illuminate, obscure or oppress. Numbers are not only symbols in the strictest sense, but are powerful representations that have considerable impact on institutions, policy, the real world and our lives. Data are said to be the \"Black gold\" of the 21st century. By use of human, economic, political and social indicators and metrics Western scientists, statisticians, governments and powerful actors have promoted liberalism, militarism and capitalism, which often dehumanized the racialized 'Other'. Various techniques in social sciences like forecasting, statistics, quantification, predicting, modeling all rely heavily on numbers or their manipulation/interpretation. But what social and economic goals and who do statistics serve? What ideologies underpin these numbers about Black people/communities? What is the significance of numbers to Black life? To what purpose have numbers been put in the furtherance of Black liberation? This course addresses these questions and the different uses to which numbers have been put by Black revolutionaries and communities. Black activists, scholars and communities have questioned how statistics are formulated, used and their Eurocentric basis as well as their limited ability to accurately reflect the Black world. We delve an alternative Black philosophy, specifically how Black people have historically used/defied/circumvented the numbers game. We will study and historically trace the invention of statistics, and how Black people, organizations and communities have utilized numbers to resist oppression, shape movements and direct emancipatory efforts. From Ida B Wells, to W. E. B. du Bois, Claudia Jones and Eric Williams, using numbers differently, has pushed back against oppression, reinterpreted history and spurred social and political change.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over-enrolled, preference to AFR majors/concentrators.","crossListing":["AFR 145","STS 145"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017761","department":"AFR","number":200,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1593,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Introduction To Africana Studies","titleShort":"Intro To Africana Studies","instructors":[{"id":12787,"name":"Keston K.

Often described as intra-racial racism, colorism within the Black American context is part of the colonial legacy of institutionalized slavery where the vestiges of white supremacy have created color castes among Blacks that still, to this day, have serious consequences for those on the darkest end of the color spectrum. The impact of this practice is far-reaching, influencing everything from romantic partnering, economic and educational attainment, and perceptions of beauty, attractiveness, and criminality. Although the vast majority of colorism scholarship is empirically based, there is much that we can glean from a literary investigation of this practice by analyzing the works of renowned writer, theorist, and folklorist Toni Morrison. Her work is particularly useful in examining issues of skin color, as this topic has been persistent yet underexplored in Morrison's writings. Employing the methods of literary and rhetorical criticism, this tutorial will investigate five Morrison novels, \u003cI\u003eThe Bluest Eye\u003c/I\u003e (1970), \u003cI\u003eSula\u003c/I\u003e (1973), \u003cI\u003eSong of Solomon\u003c/I\u003e (1977), \u003cI\u003eLove\u003c/I\u003e (2003) and \u003cI\u003eGod Help the Child\u003c/I\u003e (2015), and some of her non-fiction writings. In our discussions of each text, we will examine the problem of the \"color complex\" at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class and sexual violence, and how the characters manage these overlapping issues. We will bring the novels into conversation with social science articles on the practices of colorism in daily life. Because the tutorial blends different kinds of investigations into colorism, it will equip first year students with tools to critically engage and interrogate fictional literature; help them identify the real and nuanced ways that color discrimination affects Black communities; and consider how Morrison, one of our foremost writers, bridges literary creativity with ethnographic observation.","enrolmentPreferences":"This course is specifically for first-year students and they will receive preference in this class","crossListing":["AFR 205","WGSS 207"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"018862","department":"AFR","number":206,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3572,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Studio","titleLong":"African Dance And Percussion","titleShort":"African Dance \u0026 Percussion","instructors":[{"id":2535,"name":"Sandra L.

Through movement and rhythm, dancers experience the embodied knowledge of previous generations, while connecting to contemporary cultural, political, and economic realities.\nKatherine Dunham devoted her life to exploring and exposing the multiple layers and complexities of the African diasporic experience through her ethnographic dance choreographies, her dance technique, her schools, her music, and her writing. Dunham's work as a dance anthropologist, artist, educator, and humanitarian is manifested in Dunham Technique; the technique is a fusion of African diasporic dance, ballet and modern dance, and functions as an embodied medium for cultural communication. The technique is considered \"a way of life\" as it uses theory and philosophy to engage participants in a holistic experience that is not only physical, but also intellectual, emotional, and spiritual. Through this combination of physicality, history, theory, and philosophy, Dunham Technique is a tool to understand one's inner self and place oneself within a historical and cultural framework.\nIn this course, students will explore the history, theory, and philosophies of Dunham Technique and Katherine Dunham, while actively participating with the technique's movement concepts and vocabulary. Students will engage in the fundamentals of a Dunham Technique movement class through center floor work, barre exercises, progressions, and choreography. The course will combine the studio experience of the physical technique with lectures and discussions. Students will learn about the three theories of Dunham Technique (Form and Function, Intercultural Communication, and Socialization through the Arts) and its three philosophies (Self-Examination, Detachment, and Discrimination) while also learning the history and historical context of the technique and its creator.

These changes are not necessarily natural, uniform or linear across space and time. As colonial conquests sought to capture, dominate and exploit vast swathes of land, nature and people, supported by economic theories, violent, wide-ranging and long-term changes profoundly altered the environment and human-nature relationships. This course examines these transformations, specifically attending to the relationship between colonized/colonial (hu)man, nature and non-human species, drawing in perceptions of nature and the economy. Our starting point for this intellectual journey is the colonial imprint on human-ecological relations i.e. economic man, or Sylvia Wynter's conception of \"ethno-class man\" and \"homo-economicus\". We will consider social difference especially race as a central conjuncture of the changing relationship of capitalism and social organization relative to natural resource extraction, techno-scientific knowledge, industrial development and resulting accumulation of greenhouse gases that induce climate and ecological crises. We will also examine economic perspectives of climate change as a market failure, loss of economic value or a financial risk to stock portfolios that may be at odds with humane ways of organizing our collective planet. This course exposes the hierarchies of social difference and resulting inequalities (class, race, gender, species) under climate crisis to advance reparative and decolonial understandings. Drawing upon experiences from social, labor and environmental movements for climate justice, students will be able evaluate situated political economic responses to the climate crisis.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over enrolled preference goes to Africana Studies and then Environmental Studies students.","crossListing":["AFR 233","ENVI 204","GBST 233"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022446","department":"AFR","number":236,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1977,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Europe And The Black Diaspora","titleShort":"Europe And The Black Diaspora","instructors":[{"id":14442,"name":"Peter Ogunniran"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active class participation, written homework, short papers and final research paper.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course provides an overview of the relationships and interactions between the Black diaspora and the European continent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

His story and legacy powerfully illustrate the complex intersections of Muslim identity, political resistance, and national belonging. From the early period of \"Black Muslim\" movements represented by Malcolm X, to the current \"War on Terror\" era, American Muslims have faced a complex intersection of exclusions and marginalization, in relation to national belonging, race, and religion. Taking Malcolm X as our point of departure, this course examines how American Muslims have navigated these multiple layers of marginalization. We will therefore consider how the broader socio-political contexts that Muslims are a part of shape their visions of Islam, and how they contest these competing visions among themselves. In so doing, we will examine the complex relation between religion, race, and politics in the United States.\nThroughout the course, we will be engaging with historical and anthropological material, autobiographies, documentaries, films, historical primary-source documents, music, and social media materials. The course fosters critical thinking about diversity by challenging assumptions of who Muslims are, what being American means, and what Islam is. It also focuses on the complex interaction of different dimensions of diversity, from religion to ideology, race, nationality, ethnicity, culture, gender, and language.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and concentrators in REL, AFR, and AMST","crossListing":["REL 237","AAS 237","AFR 237","AMST 237"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011755","department":"AFR","number":242,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1066,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Introduction To The Music Of John Coltrane","titleShort":"John Coltrane","instructors":[{"id":5553,"name":"Kris Allen"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In-class participation including small quizzes, midterm, class presentation, and final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"MUS 103 and/or 203 strongly recommended; musical literacy sufficient to deal with the material and /or permission of instructor","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course offers the serious music student an opportunity to study the unique body of work produced by saxophonist and composer John Coltrane (1926-1967).

While the popularity of these dance styles has expanded and now different groups of people now embrace these movement vocabularies, the practices remain deeply connected to the history and culture of Black folk. Despite the increased popularity of these dances, within Eurocentric aesthetics, the Black dancing body carries the mark of vulgarity and should either be controlled, exploited, and/or exoticized. These dangerous bodies are considered sexually deviant and in need of influence and control through colonialism, imperialism, and religion. Yet, the dancing pelvis, hips, and butt write and document the Black experience. The dancing Black body carries the memories of the diaspora and provides space for the body to experience autonomy. This embodied knowledge, carried by Black bodies, is intertwined with the everyday lives of Black folk. Furthermore, through these practices, Black communities commune, resist dominant narratives, and embrace their humanity. Nevertheless, the pelvis/hips/butt dancing body is not embraced equally among Black people. In the practice of these movement genres, Black communities negotiate matters of respectability, pleasure, and self-actualization.\nThis course is an exploration into the use of the hips, butt, and pelvis in three movement genres: bounce, a genre of hip-hip from New Orleans and origin culture of the term \"twerking\" Black majorette/dance team performance, a jazz and Black social dance infused form that originated from the marching band culture at Historically Black Colleges and Universities; and Caribbean wining, a hip rolling movement performed throughout the Caribbean. Students will engage with scholarship and participate in discussions focused on the individual and communal practice of these traditions. The class community will investigate themes such as respectability politics, the politics of pleasure, and communal organizing to gain a better understanding of these practices. Additionally, students will physically explore these dance traditions and work with guest artists who specialize in these practices. The course will culminate in a public dance party that will be curated and facilitated by the class community.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in expanding their knowledge of African diasporic dance, particularly social dance.","crossListing":["AFR 245","DANC 220"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022363","department":"AFR","number":306,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1158,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Transcending Boundaries: The Creation And Evolution Of Creole Cultures","titleShort":"Creole Cultures And Identities","instructors":[{"id":13534,"name":"Preea Leelah"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MW","start":"11:00","end":"12:15","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active class participation, three papers (of 3-4 pages each), presentation, final research paper (7-8 pages)","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Any RLFR 200-level course or above, or by permission of instructor.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Born out of a history of resistance, Creole cultures transcend racial boundaries.

It was on the banks of this river that the great Egyptian empires were founded that led to the building of some of humanity's most astounding structures and artworks. While the Nile seems eternal and almost beyond time and place, now in the 21st century, the Nile River is at a historical turning point. The water level and quality is dwindling while at the same time the number of people who rely on the river is ever increasing. This alarming nexus of demography, climate change, and economic development has led to increasingly urgent questions of the Nile´s future. Is the Nile dying? How has the river, and people´s relationship with it, changed over the last century? This course will consider the history of the Nile and and its built and natural environment. After a brief overview of the role of the river in ancient Egypt, we will explore the modern political and cultural history of the Nile. By following an imaginary droplet flowing from tributaries until it makes its way into the Mediterranean Sea, we will learn about the diverse peoples and cultures along the way. We will evaluate the numerous attempts to manage and control the Nile, including the building of big dams, and the continuous efforts to utilize the river for economic development such as agriculture and the tourism industry. At the end of the semester we will consider the relationship of the major urban centers with the Nile and whether the tensions among Nile riparian states will lead to \"water wars\" in East Africa and the Middle East.","enrolmentPreferences":"History and Arabic Studies majors","crossListing":["AFR 350","ARAB 308","ENVI 335","GBST 320","HIST 308"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022057","department":"AFR","number":353,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1963,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Capitalism And Racism In The American Context And Beyond: A Global Approach","titleShort":"Race\u0026Capitalism: A Global View","instructors":[{"id":13445,"name":"Souhail Chichah"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Requirements: An active participation is required of students in terms of engaging in the in-class debates and weekly response paper as a feedback on the lectures as well as a final paper.

Building on this framework, this course foregrounds transepistemology as an equally important method for understanding the dynamics of America, both locally and globally, at the level of the world-system. In addition to tracing the consubstantial genealogy of racism and capitalism, we will examine their local manifestations, mainly in Asia, Europe, Africa and America, as well as their current geopolitical, social and economic outcomes, especially the reproduction of systemic inequalities and domination. Through an interdisciplinary approach and engagement with a variety of resources from economics, anthropology, sociology, critical race theory, comparative ethnic studies and decolonial thinking, this course will address the following: i) review the different forms of economic organization of human societies throughout history (with special focus on the work of Karl Polanyi); ii) trace the epistemological origins of capitalism and investigate what makes capitalism and its crises unique; iii) trace the genealogy of the concepts of race, racism and discrimination; iv) interrogate the intersection of racism and capitalism in different traditions of thought and epistemologies in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. For example, we will read key texts from \"French theory\", (Deleuze, Foucault, etc.), US Black tradition, (W. E. B. Du Bois and Cedric Robison, etc.), Chinese social sciences (Li Shenming, Cheng Enfu, etc.) and African economy and anthropology (Mahdi Elmandjra, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.) and Latin American decolonial philosophy (Quijano, Dussel, Mignolo, etc.) By doing this, we will situate the rupture that capitalism and racism introduced at the level of global history, which is the first step to conceptualizing racism and capitalism. After showing that the development of capitalism and racism are historically linked, we will proceed to examine the manifestations of their interaction at local and global levels. Locally, we will focus on the effects of racism on the labor market: discrimination in hiring, wage discrimination, segregation, duality and stratification of the labor market, etc. We will also analyze how sexism and racism play out in the labor market in racialized communities. We will also reflect on the links between racism and politics and their effects on economic policies. From a more global perspective, we will analyze the roots of the global economic crisis and the resulting geopolitical issues at the international level and the racist dynamics they generate. Overall, as we will move through readings, we will situate the United States in a cross-regional perspective that would enable us to develop critical insights concerning links and convergences between capitalism and racism.","enrolmentPreferences":"American Studies majors and seniors","crossListing":["AFR 353","AMST 345","GBST 344"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022433","department":"AFR","number":364,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3907,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Black Political Thought","titleShort":"Black Political Thought","instructors":[{"id":14436,"name":"Da'Von A.

Using the lens of performance on racial identity foregrounds the active and shifting nature of race in contrast to the potentially passive, static connotation of construction. But what is this term performance that is now so widely used as to be an anathema? In this course, we explore performance broadly as entertainment, representation, social function, and lived experience. By the end of the course, students will analyze multiple performance types from theatrical and dance performance to performance of race in everyday life. They will also study and practice at least four core black performance studies methodologies: oral interpretation of literature, ethnography, written performance analysis, and embodied performance (i.e. movement, music and/or theatre). In this way, students will begin to understand performance as both subject matter and method. The course will be structured around discussions, written responses, and performance exercises that help students analyze and practice each methodology. At the end of the semester, students will create final creative research projects that articulate key theories of black performance studies and draw on at least one of the featured performance methodologies.

From the early period of \"Black Muslim\" movements represented by Malcolm X, to the current \"War on Terror\" era, American Muslims have faced a complex intersection of exclusions and marginalization, in relation to national belonging, race, and religion. Taking Malcolm X as our point of departure, this course examines how American Muslims have navigated these multiple layers of marginalization. We will therefore consider how the broader socio-political contexts that Muslims are a part of shape their visions of Islam, and how they contest these competing visions among themselves. In so doing, we will examine the complex relation between religion, race, and politics in the United States.\nThroughout the course, we will be engaging with historical and anthropological material, autobiographies, documentaries, films, historical primary-source documents, music, and social media materials. The course fosters critical thinking about diversity by challenging assumptions of who Muslims are, what being American means, and what Islam is. It also focuses on the complex interaction of different dimensions of diversity, from religion to ideology, race, nationality, ethnicity, culture, gender, and language.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and concentrators in REL, AFR, and AMST","crossListing":["REL 237","AAS 237","AFR 237","AMST 237"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019191","department":"AMST","number":244,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1662,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"What They Saw In America","titleShort":"What They Saw In America","instructors":[{"id":2217,"name":"James L.

This course centers on the critical role of lived experience as a key site of everyday theorization for the multiply marginalized, and specifically on the ways in which invisibly disabled Latinx, Asian American, and Black American individuals write the self. As scholars in disability studies argue, self-representations of disabled individuals carry the potential for us as a society to move beyond the binary narratives of \"tragedy or inspiration\" so often associated with disability. Rather, the self-produced narratives of US disabled writers of color offer a much more nuanced portrayal of everyday life with disability/ies for the multiply marginalized. Much like invisible disability itself, these self-representations ultimately refute traditional depictions of disability, and underscore the ways in which the bodymind serves as a rich, albeit often overlooked, site of knowledge.\nEmbodied Knowledges draws on the insights of disability studies, crip studies, anthropology, literary studies, medicine, psychology, education, cultural studies, ethnic studies, American studies, gender and sexuality studies, sociology, and trauma studies.

It also introduces foundational methodologies in Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS) and strategies for pursuing decolonizing scholarship and action. Emphasis is on primary and secondary works produced by Indigenous authors/creators. Starting with the diversity of Indigenous societies that have inhabited and cared for lands and waters since \"time out of mind,\" it foregrounds the complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews situated in particular homelands, as well as accounts of origins and migrations. It addresses how societies confronted devastating epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial processes of colonization, extraction, and enslavement. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and homelands through pervasive violence, attempted genocide, and dispossession are addressed, as well as forms of relations and kinship with African-American and Afro-Indigenous people. It concludes with how different communities negotiated the tumultuous eras of the American Revolution, forced removal in the 1830s, and Civil War, and created pathways for endurance, self-determination, and security in its aftermath. The course centers on Indigenous actors--intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and many others--and consistently connects historical events with present-day matters of land, historical memory, education, caretaking, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum.

We will also explore how BIPOC artists, architects, writers, and scholars engage architecture as a standpoint of critique, pushing back against the racialization of architecture and offer alternative or new ways of thinking about structures and space. While foregrounding race, the course will necessarily require intersectional thinking in relation (but not limited) to class, gender, citizenship, and ability.","enrolmentPreferences":"First- and second-year students","crossListing":["AAS 306","AMST 306","ARTH 306"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"019250","department":"AMST","number":313,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3216,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Gender, Race, And The Power Of Personal Aesthetics","titleShort":"Gender, Race, Beauty, Power","instructors":[{"id":2590,"name":"Maria Elena Cepeda"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Participation, one student-led discussion period, two written essays of 5-7 pages, final written reflection.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"LATS 105, AMST 201, AFR 200, WGSS 101 or permission of instructor; first year students are not permitted to take this course.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course focuses on the politics of personal style among women of color in the digital era.

Few would argue that any one work of fiction could capture the essence of American life. In this class, we will flip the Great American Novel on its head by reading Ralph Ellison's unfinished second novel. After publishing the acclaimed Invisible Man in 1952, Ellison seemed poised to deliver the next Great American Novel. But he never did. When he died in 1994, 42 years later, he left behind thousands of pages of material, but no finished second novel. Why wasn't he able to finish it? Some of it was bad luck. Some of it was a struggle with genre and form. However, perhaps the real reason Ellison's novel proved impossible is what it was trying to say. This is a book about the historical trauma of racism. Therefore, the thesis of this class is that the Great American Novel cannot be written as long as American history remains whitewashed. Ellison's manuscript shows this in surprising ways, from its depiction of racial passing and the taboo of interracial sex to its extended exploration of Black and Indigenous cultures in the former Oklahoma Territory. In addition to Ellison, we will read the work of the Chicano author Tomás Rivera, whose fragmentary fictions provoke similar questions. This class culminates in a final project that asks students to \"unfinish\" an American cultural object.","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors","crossListing":["AMST 326","ENGL 316"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022057","department":"AMST","number":345,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1962,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Capitalism And Racism In The American Context And Beyond: A Global Approach","titleShort":"Race\u0026Capitalism: A Global View","instructors":[{"id":13445,"name":"Souhail Chichah"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Requirements: An active participation is required of students in terms of engaging in the in-class debates and weekly response paper as a feedback on the lectures as well as a final paper.

Building on this framework, this course foregrounds transepistemology as an equally important method for understanding the dynamics of America, both locally and globally, at the level of the world-system. In addition to tracing the consubstantial genealogy of racism and capitalism, we will examine their local manifestations, mainly in Asia, Europe, Africa and America, as well as their current geopolitical, social and economic outcomes, especially the reproduction of systemic inequalities and domination. Through an interdisciplinary approach and engagement with a variety of resources from economics, anthropology, sociology, critical race theory, comparative ethnic studies and decolonial thinking, this course will address the following: i) review the different forms of economic organization of human societies throughout history (with special focus on the work of Karl Polanyi); ii) trace the epistemological origins of capitalism and investigate what makes capitalism and its crises unique; iii) trace the genealogy of the concepts of race, racism and discrimination; iv) interrogate the intersection of racism and capitalism in different traditions of thought and epistemologies in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. For example, we will read key texts from \"French theory\", (Deleuze, Foucault, etc.), US Black tradition, (W. E. B. Du Bois and Cedric Robison, etc.), Chinese social sciences (Li Shenming, Cheng Enfu, etc.) and African economy and anthropology (Mahdi Elmandjra, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.) and Latin American decolonial philosophy (Quijano, Dussel, Mignolo, etc.) By doing this, we will situate the rupture that capitalism and racism introduced at the level of global history, which is the first step to conceptualizing racism and capitalism. After showing that the development of capitalism and racism are historically linked, we will proceed to examine the manifestations of their interaction at local and global levels. Locally, we will focus on the effects of racism on the labor market: discrimination in hiring, wage discrimination, segregation, duality and stratification of the labor market, etc. We will also analyze how sexism and racism play out in the labor market in racialized communities. We will also reflect on the links between racism and politics and their effects on economic policies. From a more global perspective, we will analyze the roots of the global economic crisis and the resulting geopolitical issues at the international level and the racist dynamics they generate. Overall, as we will move through readings, we will situate the United States in a cross-regional perspective that would enable us to develop critical insights concerning links and convergences between capitalism and racism.","enrolmentPreferences":"American Studies majors and seniors","crossListing":["AFR 353","AMST 345","GBST 344"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021390","department":"AMST","number":360,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3869,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"The Atlantic World: Connections, Crossings, And Confluences","titleShort":"Atlantic World Histories","instructors":[{"id":11198,"name":"Christine DeLucia"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active participation in class discussion, several short essays based on readings and discussion topics, museum/archives exercise, final essay/project","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course considers the Atlantic World as both a real place and a concept: an ocean surrounded and shaped by diverse people and communities, and an imagined space of shared or competing affiliations.

Attentive to the structures of power that inflect every part of Atlantic histories, it offers specific ethical frameworks for approaching these topics.

In recent history, people marked as \"disabled\" have been subject to medical scrutiny, labeled deficient or defective, and often barred from full participation in society. And yet, what counts as \"disability\"--and who counts as disabled--varies greatly depending on cultural and historical context. Arguably, disability has more to do with social conditions than with any innate characteristics of disabled people themselves.\nThis class introduces disability studies, situating disability within its historical, political, and cultural contexts. As a GWSS course, we'll center queer and feminist perspectives; this class also emphasizes recent work. Echoing arguments in gender and sexuality studies, scholars have insisted that disability is not a natural or biological fact, but a socially constructed category. As such, scholars and activists have challenged medical models that conceptualize disability as an individual defect in need of elimination. They have also questioned the idea that disability is simply a minority identity -- to the contrary, disability is a condition that most humans will experience at some point in our lives.\nThis class frames \"disability\" broadly--encompassing not just conditions of physical impairment, but a wide range of bodily, sensory, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral differences and capacities. This class also centers how disability is produced intersectionally through regimes like race, capitalism, and empire. Topics include: theories of embodiment, eugenics, institutionalization and incarceration, neurodivergence, mad studies, the politics of health, storytelling and narrative, disability justice activism, neoliberalism, biopolitics, and crip theory. Along with scholarly writings, we'll consider activist texts, popular press, fiction, memoir, and a variety of other media.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference to majors, 3rd and 4th year students.","crossListing":["AMST 369","WGSS 332"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022305","department":"AMST","number":371,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3560,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Rebels, Guerillas, And Insurgents: Resistance And Repression In US History","titleShort":"Rebels, Guerillas, Insurgents","instructors":[{"id":13554,"name":"Stefan B.

From the scientific fantasy of bombproofing and \"safety in space,\" to the fears of both racial and radioactive contamination that drove the creation of the American suburbs, the affective and material dimensions of nuclear weaponry have, from the beginning, been entangled with race. Drawing on the critical and analytical toolkits of American Studies and media archaeology, students will dig beneath the surface of received narratives about the arms race, the space race, and race itself. Students will uncover generative connections between mineral extraction, the oppression of Indigenous populations, the destructive legacies of \"urban renewal,\" and the figure of the \"typical American family\" huddled in their backyard bunker.

Modernist Studies is at the moment undergoing a major and exciting shift made possible by digital archives that allow us to access and document the rich intertextual experience of reading Modernism as it unfolded in the influential little magazines that came to define Modernisms. Some, like Poetry magazine, defined the new poetry strictly along aesthetic lines and treated these publications as collectible objects. Others, such as The Crisis, brought together poetry and the politics of race and social justice and encouraged, as Bartholomew Brinkman has argued, \"both aesthetic and socially engaged readings.\" We take advantage of digital archives, as well as physical ones, in order to tell new stories about both familiar and unfamiliar writers that can be discovered at the intersections of literary history and archives. Students will also have the opportunity to work in the Sterling Brown archive here at Williams. Recently acquired by Williams College Library Special Collections, this significant archive documents the life, work, and poetic practice of African-American writer and educator Sterling Brown, whose poetry and prose spans nearly five decades of the twentieth century, yet Brown has often been left out of the narrative we tell about modern poetry. Work in the Sterling Brown archive will culminate in a curated public exhibition featuring your discoveries. Iain Bailey has argued that we should think of the archive \"as a place of work, rather than as a cache from which to draw certainties.\" With this caveat in mind and in the spirit of discovery, we will act over the course of the semester as investigators, curators, collaborators, and inquirers in the workshop of literary production and its aesthetic products.","enrolmentPreferences":"English Majors, American Studies Majors","crossListing":["AMST 418","ENGL 418"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021392","department":"AMST","number":455,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1914,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Material Cultures In North American History","titleShort":"N.

Tangible items like clothing, furniture, tools, and the built environment are all shaped by communities' identities, aspirations, resources, struggles, and forms of power. This course approaches North American histories through the lens of materiality, and examines how interdisciplinary methodologies can illuminate multiple or alternate understandings of the past--and its continuing impacts in the twenty-first century. While many historians emphasize written archives and documents as primary sources, scholars and practitioners of material culture studies center everyday as well as exceptional material items that communities have produced and interacted with over many generations. Equally important are the afterlives of these items. At different turns, and across time, social groups have cherished certain belongings; contested, rejected, or remade them; ascribed and activated meanings that may be very different from what the original makers conceived. These continuing transits compel reckoning with major issues of justice, rights, restitution, and sovereignty. The course traces key theories, ethics, and practices of caretaking, preservation, repatriation, curation, creative re-making, and digitization. Members will participate in a series of visits to area museums, collections, and meaningful places to deepen skills of critical analysis. The scope of the course is North American and at times transoceanic. It also includes substantial focus on our location in the Northeast and local formations of materiality and memory, as well as topics in Native American and Indigenous Studies, settler colonialism, and decolonizing approaches. Class members will build familiarity with appropriate techniques for approaching and handling different forms of material culture. They will also cultivate skills for developing and carrying out an original research project; and explore diverse modes of analysis and expression for representing the stories of materials and the communities who engage with them.","enrolmentPreferences":"If overenrolled, junior and senior History and American Studies majors","crossListing":["AMST 455","HIST 455"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010258","department":"AMST","number":491,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1570,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Honors Project: American Studies","titleShort":"Sen Honors: American Studies","instructors":[{"id":12021,"name":"Jan Padios"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Satisfactory completion of the course will be required for students to continue on in the honors program.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"AMST seniors who have been approved to write an honors thesis (critical-analytical, research-focused, creative, performative, or hybrid).","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This seminar is the first half of a year-long seminar that is required of AMST seniors who have been approved to write an honors thesis (critical-analytical, research-focused, creative, performative, or hybrid).

From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in what they called the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey), the place of Christ's life, death, and believed resurrection. Large numbers of pilgrims even made the long journey to the Holy Land, and especially to Jerusalem, to visit a range of sacred sites related to Christ and his saints. When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century -- and even before this time -- Europeans sought to recreate many of them at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser \"crusades.\" Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. Through all of these centuries, moreover, the Christian, Greek-speaking empire of Byzantium, focused on its great capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), interacted in myriad ways, both friendly and hostile, with the Latin-speaking polities of Western Europe, focused at least symbolically on their ancient capital of Rome. Together, by way of open discussion, we will explore artistic production within each of these different cross-cultural contexts of East-West encounter. In the process, we will reflect on how art could function as a conduit for the exchange of ideas in the Middle Ages, and how it could be used both to negotiate and to intensify cultural difference.","enrolmentPreferences":"First- and second-year students, but open to all","crossListing":["ARAB 212","ARTH 212","REL 210"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022277","department":"ARAB","number":214,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3167,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Divas And Dervishes: Introduction To Modern Arab Music And Performance","titleShort":"Arab Music And Performance","instructors":[{"id":12792,"name":"Nicholas R Mangialardi"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In-class participation, short essays (1 page) every two weeks, midterm presentation, and a final paper (12-14 pages).","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"From Sufi rituals to revolutionary uprisings, music has long played a central role in the social, political, and religious life of the Arab world.

How is music used to define social groups and negotiate identity, gender, and class? Which musical characteristics are associated with Arab \"heritage\" and \"modernity,\" and how are these performed? In what ways does music shape everyday life in the Arab world?

The water level and quality is dwindling while at the same time the number of people who rely on the river is ever increasing. This alarming nexus of demography, climate change, and economic development has led to increasingly urgent questions of the Nile´s future. Is the Nile dying? How has the river, and people´s relationship with it, changed over the last century? This course will consider the history of the Nile and and its built and natural environment. After a brief overview of the role of the river in ancient Egypt, we will explore the modern political and cultural history of the Nile. By following an imaginary droplet flowing from tributaries until it makes its way into the Mediterranean Sea, we will learn about the diverse peoples and cultures along the way. We will evaluate the numerous attempts to manage and control the Nile, including the building of big dams, and the continuous efforts to utilize the river for economic development such as agriculture and the tourism industry. At the end of the semester we will consider the relationship of the major urban centers with the Nile and whether the tensions among Nile riparian states will lead to \"water wars\" in East Africa and the Middle East.","enrolmentPreferences":"History and Arabic Studies majors","crossListing":["GBST 320","HIST 308","AFR 350","ARAB 308","ENVI 335"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020240","department":"ARAB","number":332,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3726,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Islam And Feminism","titleShort":"Islam And Feminism","instructors":[{"id":5583,"name":"Saadia Yacoob"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"11:20","end":"12:35","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Weekly responses, midterm essay, final research paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course examines the relationship between feminism and Islam, focusing particularly on Islamic feminist scholarship.

Finally, the last part of our course will explore the breadth of Islamic feminist literature, covering the following themes: 1) feminist readings of scripture; 2) feminist critiques of Islamic law; and 3) feminist theology.","enrolmentPreferences":"Religion, Arabic Studies, Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies, History majors","crossListing":["ARAB 332","REL 332","WGSS 334"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021356","department":"ARAB","number":363,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3171,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Where Are All The Jews?","titleShort":"Where Are All The Jews?","instructors":[{"id":10244,"name":"Brahim El Guabli"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"400-word weekly, focused responses on Glow; a book review (600 words); two five-page papers as mid-terms; one ten-page final paper; one presentation.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Until four decades ago, many Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cities and villages teemed with Jewish populations. However, the creation of the Alliance Israelite Universelle's schools (1830s), the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the decolonization process in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War accelerated the departure of Arab and Berber Jews from their homelands to other destinations, including France, Israel, Canada, the United States, and different Latin American countries. Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in critical and comparative literary, religious or historical studies.","crossListing":["REL 268","ARAB 363","COMP 363","JWST 268"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022401","department":"ARAB","number":403,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1175,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Beyond The Letter: Visual Culture In The Arabic-Speaking World","titleShort":"Beyond The Letter","instructors":[{"id":3014,"name":"Amal Eqeiq"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MWF","start":"11:00","end":"12:15","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active in-class participation; active participation in discussion forums on GLOW; weekly writing assignments of 2-3pages; two in-class presentations; a final 10-pages essay.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"ARAB 302","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Whereas poetry has been historically celebrated as the defining form of an \"authentic\" Arab culture from the pre-Islamic world to the present, visual culture, such as paintings, sculptures, installations, videoart, and photography, among others, has been relegated to the contemporary, the modern, the Westernized, and thereof, a representation of a less \"authentic\" Arab culture.

We will also examine the work of poets-painters, such as Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Etel Adnan that expanded from Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq to the United States, the manifestos of the Arab Surrealist Movement in Cairo in the 1930s, the Baghdad Modern Art Group in the 1950s and more recent works by individual artists navigating post-modern aesthetics, and dystopian futures, including Radia Bent Lhoucine, Amina Zoubair, Sophia Al-Maria and Juamana Manna, among others. In discussing these works, we will reflect on political and social events that shaped the production of visual culture in the Arabic-speaking world from the Gulf to the Maghreb.

Key themes of the course include bronzes, lacquerware, ceramics, tomb building, Buddhist reliquaries, ink painting, wood-block printmaking, and timber frame architecture. Students will learn about the development of art and artisanal practices in East Asia, while gaining a broader understanding of the continuity and discontinuity of the local artistic traditions in relation to the region's history, politics, religion, and culture. East Asia boasts a history of art that stretches five thousand years. In addition to gaining an overview of important artistic traditions in the region through the lectures, students will develop visual analysis skills and engage with critical methodologies in East Asian art through closelooking exercises and discussion-driven case studies during sections. The course pays special attention to how the constant cross-cultural exchanges between China, Japan, and Korea contributed to the development of art in unique ways across time. What is the shape of \"East Asian art\"? How does art help define East Asia culturally? And what does it tell us about East Asia's past, present, and future?

Similarly, they also differ in their language, dress, diet, rituals and politics. However, parallel to the wealth of diversity, South Asia also demonstrates a rich history of interconnectedness. This complex web of culture, language, religion and politics is best manifested in the arts of the region. How does visual culture reflect regional variations? How does a survey of artistic style and iconography help uncover networks of exchange across South Asia? What role did the arts play in the expression of religious traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Islam? With these questions in mind, this course is designed as a survey of the arts of South Asia starting with the height of the Indus Valley Civilization in 2600 BCE and ending in 1857 CE, a date that marks the cessation of independent rule in South Asia. Using the study of architecture, painting, sculpture and textiles, students will learn how to make stylistic and iconographic analyses, while also improving their art historical writing and analytic skills.","enrolmentPreferences":"First years, sophomores and juniors","crossListing":["ASIA 105","ARTH 105"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021566","department":"ARTH","number":106,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1315,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"An Invitation To World Architecture","titleShort":"World Architecture","instructors":[{"id":5558,"name":"Michelle M.

From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in what they called the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey), the place of Christ's life, death, and believed resurrection. Large numbers of pilgrims even made the long journey to the Holy Land, and especially to Jerusalem, to visit a range of sacred sites related to Christ and his saints. When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century -- and even before this time -- Europeans sought to recreate many of them at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser \"crusades.\" Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. Through all of these centuries, moreover, the Christian, Greek-speaking empire of Byzantium, focused on its great capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), interacted in myriad ways, both friendly and hostile, with the Latin-speaking polities of Western Europe, focused at least symbolically on their ancient capital of Rome. Together, by way of open discussion, we will explore artistic production within each of these different cross-cultural contexts of East-West encounter. In the process, we will reflect on how art could function as a conduit for the exchange of ideas in the Middle Ages, and how it could be used both to negotiate and to intensify cultural difference.","enrolmentPreferences":"First- and second-year students, but open to all","crossListing":["ARAB 212","ARTH 212","REL 210"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021326","department":"ARTH","number":213,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3446,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"The Human Figure In The Ancient Mediterranean","titleShort":"The Body In Ancient Art","instructors":[{"id":2175,"name":"Elizabeth P.

The course then considers the critiques of those methods that emerged in the middle twentieth century from the fields of iconology, marxism, feminism, structuralism, and ethnic studies, among others. The course concludes with a consideration of the current revival of interest in the writings of the first art historians coming from perspectives such as phenomenology, aesthetics, anthropology, new materialism, \"Bildwissenschaft,\" and neo-formalism.

Comparing institutions past and present internationally, seminar participants will envision the art museum's future while addressing programmatic and organizational challenges at this moment of participatory civic engagement and social, political unrest. With growing skepticism of institutional collecting practices and authoritative narratives, art museums, especially those in the United States, face internal and external pressure to \"decolonize\" as they attempt to alter their canon. There is pressure, as well, to embrace a more active role in climate and social justice movements. It is a time marked by calls for compensation transparency, participatory decision making, staff and trustee diversity, and greater scrutiny of funders. The seminar will consider this environment against past and current norms of governance, management and curatorial policies and practices. We will examine the traditional role of architecture and installation in interpretation and experience, prevailing and proposed guidelines in the accessioning and deaccessioning of works of art and both internal and external attitudes towards the repatriation and restitution of cultural property. Studying museums ranging in size and type from the \"encyclopedic\" to newly established contemporary arts institutions and alternative spaces, seminar participants will hear how museum leaders are dealing with challenges to current practice through weekly zoom sessions. Participants will also ponder how future museums might strive to balance the institution's traditional scholarly and artistic role with new civic and social responsibilities, mindful of financial stability in a market-driven, metric-conscious, not-for-profit environment; doing so while addressing, in proposed program and practice, the demands on museums emanating from a more ethically insistent internal and external world.","enrolmentPreferences":"Graduate students, then senior art history majors, then other undergraduates","crossListing":["ARTH 501","LEAD 301","ARTH 401"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"014316","department":"ARTH","number":402,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1378,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Monuments And The Art Of Memorial","titleShort":"Monuments \u0026 Art Of Memorial","instructors":[{"id":2175,"name":"Elizabeth P.

Individuals, heroic acts, and historic events have been marked by mounds, architecture, images, words, and ephemera for over 5000 years. The value of the subject or focus of a commemoration changes over time. Entropy, iconoclasm, and vandalism have been seen as either positive or negative modes of destruction. Recent events have brought into high relief monuments long taken for granted as markers of the American urban landscape. Calls for the removal of monuments that have elevated individuals implicated in colonialism and racism have led to a powerful surge in alternative monument-making, and brought commemorative images back into public consciousness. Over the course of the seminar students will document and explore the concepts behind monuments and memorials in the Western tradition from their origins in the ancient Mediterranean (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Imperial Rome), and chart their reception, interpretation, destruction, and/or influence in later periods. We will also analyze the abstraction and inversion of monumental form, seen in the counter monuments of the late twentieth century such as Maya Lin's \u003cI\u003eVietnam Veterans Memorial\u003c/I\u003e (1982) or Gunter Demnig's \u003cI\u003eStumbling Stones \u003c/I\u003eproject (\u003cI\u003eStolpersteine\u003c/I\u003e, 1992-the present), the world's largest decentralized memorial for the victims of Nazi terror.

Disability Studies is an extremely active and rich body of literature and art that has not often been brought into conversation with historical periods of art, and so this seminar seeks to open up discussion of the insights possible from that conversation, not only how Late Antique art can be re-interpreted, but also how that period of art can reveal under-explored areas in the field of Disability Studies.

This seminar explores the theoretical roots of their architecture, its philosophical sources in transcendentalism, Unitarianism, German romanticism; and treating such aspects as decorative arts, architectural education and theory, and architectural autobiography.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior Art majors and graduate students","crossListing":["ARTH 442"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020419","department":"ARTH","number":472,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1379,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Timelines","titleShort":"Timelines","instructors":[{"id":2157,"name":"Holly Edwards"}],"meetings":[{"days":"R","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Regular attendance and active class participation, Glow Posts, term project.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"One studio or art history class","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"\"Art\" is really time-consuming--to make, to view, to use, to understand.

Great art can be inspiring, enabling people to transcend time, or it can be traumatizing, making time stop altogether. Or both! To explore such powers, we will begin in the 19th century, when commonplace notions of past and present wobbled seriously with the invention of photography and the avid pursuit of archaeology. Thereafter, we will concentrate on the period between 1870 and 1930, but also operate across time and space. There will be no single story-line, but rather a series of case studies, ranging from iconic paintings and sacred spaces to photojournalism.

Comparing institutions past and present internationally, seminar participants will envision the art museum's future while addressing programmatic and organizational challenges at this moment of participatory civic engagement and social, political unrest. With growing skepticism of institutional collecting practices and authoritative narratives, art museums, especially those in the United States, face internal and external pressure to \"decolonize\" as they attempt to alter their canon. There is pressure, as well, to embrace a more active role in climate and social justice movements. It is a time marked by calls for compensation transparency, participatory decision making, staff and trustee diversity, and greater scrutiny of funders. The seminar will consider this environment against past and current norms of governance, management and curatorial policies and practices. We will examine the traditional role of architecture and installation in interpretation and experience, prevailing and proposed guidelines in the accessioning and deaccessioning of works of art and both internal and external attitudes towards the repatriation and restitution of cultural property. Studying museums ranging in size and type from the \"encyclopedic\" to newly established contemporary arts institutions and alternative spaces, seminar participants will hear how museum leaders are dealing with challenges to current practice through weekly zoom sessions. Participants will also ponder how future museums might strive to balance the institution's traditional scholarly and artistic role with new civic and social responsibilities, mindful of financial stability in a market-driven, metric-conscious, not-for-profit environment; doing so while addressing, in proposed program and practice, the demands on museums emanating from a more ethically insistent internal and external world.","enrolmentPreferences":"Graduate students, then senior art history majors, then other undergraduates","crossListing":["ARTH 401","ARTH 501","LEAD 301"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021002","department":"ARTH","number":503,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3485,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: Transatlantic Landscape","titleShort":"CVSP: Transatlantic Landscape","instructors":[{"id":14426,"name":"Michael P.

Embodied in satyrs, sphinxes, centaurs, nymphs, and other part-human, part-animal beings is an alternative evolutionary and cultural history. In it, humans and animals live as one. There is no distinction between nature and culture. Male and female are equal. The industrial revolution never happens. This course traces the history of interspecies beings from their origin in ancient Greek art and poetry until today. Three points are important: 1) the relationship between the imagery and ancient political theory about \"primitive\" life; 2) evolving conceptions of biology and the environment, and 3) the role played by interspecies beings in the conceptualization of what is possible in art. The first half of the course examines the origins and character of interspecies beings in works of ancient art such as the Parthenon, and in ancient writers including Hesiod and Ovid. We examine relevant religious practices, materialist conceptions of nature, and biological theories of speciation, in Empedokles, On nature, Euripides' Bakchai, Plato's Phaidros, and Lucretius' De rerum natura. The second half of the course investigates the survival of classical monsters in the work of early-modern artists such as Botticelli, Michelangelo, Titian, and Dürer, and the rediscovery of ancient materialist theory. We consider the role played by interspecies beings in the formation of late modernism in art and literature. Key texts include Rousseau and Hobbes, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, Mallarmé's \"L'Apres midi d'une faun,\" and Stoppard's Arcadia. Problems include the relationship between nymphs and sex-workers in Manet, the meaning of the Minotaur in Picasso, and the interest in interspecies beings in the work of women surrealists such as Leonora Carrington. We conclude with contemporary popular culture such as the Hunger Games.","enrolmentPreferences":"Priority goes to graduate students in art history.

Why is image-making so hotly contested in Islam? What is the history of figural depictions in this tradition? The seminar explores artworks made for Muslim patrons from the medieval period to the modern era, considering how paintings produced for Muslim audiences can be situated within the frameworks of \"Islamic art,\" a loaded historiographical term that has been questioned in recent times. The seminar also addresses some of the major problems that continue to haunt art scholarship in the field. For most of its history, the academic study of Islamic art has seldom considered contemporaneous literary voices that shed light on the motivations behind artworks. Furthermore, the historiography, deeply entrenched in its colonial and orientalist roots, has largely isolated images from their supporting texts--a curious oversight in light of the fact that painting in Muslim lands has historically been primarily an art of the book. These biases have affected the way museums have collected, displayed and interpreted paintings. For example, Western museums continue to place figural depictions made for books and albums in \"South Asian\" collections while textual manuscripts and calligraphic specimens made for the same Muslim audiences--even at times bound in the same albums--are categorized as \"Islamic art.\" What does this isolation of text from image imply about prevailing views of Islamic art? To better understand the cultural, historical and religious context surrounding artworks students will read primary literature ranging from autobiography to devotional poetry, often written by the very patrons and subjects of the paintings to be discussed.","enrolmentPreferences":"MA students, then advanced undergraduates","crossListing":["ARTH 521","REL 420"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022346","department":"ARTH","number":522,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1523,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Festivities In The Early Modern World: Performance, Knowledge, And Difference","titleShort":"Early Modern Festivities","instructors":[{"id":9476,"name":"Alexander Bevilacqua"}],"meetings":[{"days":"T","start":"10:00","end":"12:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Engaged participation in discussions; in-class presentation; proposal and bibliography; research paper.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"For undergraduates, at least two prior courses in or related to History or Art History.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"In 1860, Jacob Burckhardt put festivals at the center of his influential study of Renaissance Italy.

In this seminar we will seek to establish why festivities were so intrinsic to early modern culture, and what work they did. To what extent was performing a form of knowledge? How did festivity mediate early global interaction? We will consider, moreover, the many ways in which ephemeral events were commemorated in paintings and prints, and to what extent historians can recapture the early modern festivity today. Beyond Europe, we will investigate how the festival cultures of the Americas, of Africa, and of Asia interacted with European festival traditions, whether in Goa, Pernambuco, or Mexico City. Ultimately, we will ask: what might an early modern cultural history focused on festivities reveal? We will approach this history through a combination of primary materials drawn from the holdings of Williams College's Chapin Library and secondary readings, which will range from classics in the field to the most recent scholarship.

Is it more economical to purchase art at auction or to work with dealers or (for contemporary works) directly with artists? Do museums consider value in the same way as private collectors? What role does an object's history and condition play in the evaluation process? In this course students will work as teams to identify and propose objects for addition to the collection of the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA). A significant budget will be made available for the acquisition. We will discuss approaches for identification, acquisition and evaluation of objects. Student teams will be responsible for identifying a set of objects that would make appropriate additions to the WCMA collection, and a strategy for acquiring one or more of those objects. Working with the advice of WCMA curatorial staff, one or more of these objects will be acquired using the agreed strategy, and the object will become part of the WCMA permanent collection.

Despite common perceptions of Realism as the prevailing force at mid-century, many contradictory impulses were simultaneously at work. The Romantic strain in visual art continued, though sometimes in sublimated form, and historicizing and avant-garde perspectives alike jockeyed for influence in art criticism, sales rooms, and exhibition venues. Abetting this collision of styles was a proliferation of new media in visual culture more broadly.\nFocusing on European and American examples from the middle decades of the nineteenth century, this course addresses the emergence of new tendencies in art and the persistence or revival of old ones. We will explore a variety of topics, including the invention of photography and its impact on other image-making techniques; the opening of Japan and the vogue for Japonisme; medieval nostalgia in the face of rampant Haussmannization; and the role of tradition in vanguard art. On the American side, we will consider printmaking and photography as tools of documentation and self-fashioning during the Civil War era.\nThis course will take place in the Manton Study Center for Works on Paper. Each session will engage directly with works from the Clark's collection, to be discussed and analyzed in conjunction with critical and theoretical readings.","enrolmentPreferences":"Graduate students first.

With commercial and artistic relationships that spread his influence across the globe, Gérôme has come to seem very much like a highly successful contemporary artist, specifically with regard to his place in an international art world that married elite institutional practices to new technologies of reproduction, marketing techniques, and other instruments of modern mass culture. Gérôme's fame was short lived, however. In the wake of the Modernist revolution on the one hand, and Post-Colonial critique on the other, no discussion of the artist can avoid wrestling with complaints that have left him thoroughly diminished--though less forgotten than scorned. Not only did his art, as it seemed, help perpetrate a gigantic aesthetic error, it blundered onto ethically compromising terrain. Today Gérôme stands as Exhibit A in wide-ranging critique of Orientalism's ideological work. The course will interrogate the Modernist and Post-Colonial complaints against Gérôme in detail, even as it also explores his art from a range of other perspectives, many developed very recently. Topics include Gérôme's relationship to photography, to Orientalism and animal studies, to the cinema, to polychrome sculpture, his approach to historical narrative, and well as his voyeurism and other other manipulations of viewer experience so critical to his art.\nThe seminar will engage the Clark's important collection of Gérôme paintings, and also travel to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, conditions permitting. Students may prepare papers on any aspect of global late-nineteenth-century \"academic\" or \"official\" art that was informed by Gérôme's example.","enrolmentPreferences":"MA students, then art history majors","crossListing":["ARTH 569"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"018744","department":"ARTS","number":100,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3458,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Studio","titleLong":"Drawing I","titleShort":"Drawing I","instructors":[{"id":2232,"name":"Michael A.

The seminar has a studio component that consists of an urban project where students will apply theories and approaches to a real case study using digital art (2D and 3D modeling).","enrolmentPreferences":"Envi majors and concentrators, Studio Art majors","crossListing":["ARTS 316","ENVI 316"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010547","department":"ARTS","number":319,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1398,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Studio","titleLong":"Junior Seminar","titleShort":"Junior Seminar","instructors":[{"id":10264,"name":"Pallavi Sen"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Quality of work produced, participation in class discussions and critiques, successful completion of all assignments, and attendance","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Three studio courses required for the major","departmentNotes":"Studio Art and Art History and Practice majors are required to take this course in the junior year unless studying abroad during the fall semester","descriptionSearch":"Junior Seminar is a dynamic and immersive class tailored for art majors, aimed at exploring and fortifying their creative interests through a rigorous studio practice, engaging group discussions, and exposure to current themes, topics, materials, and concerns in contemporary art and its allied disciplines.\nThrough a multifaceted approach that includes readings, presentations, lectures by visiting artists, and visits to art institutions and artists' studios, students will be immersed in the vibrant and interdisciplinary nature of contemporary art.

Similarly, they also differ in their language, dress, diet, rituals and politics. However, parallel to the wealth of diversity, South Asia also demonstrates a rich history of interconnectedness. This complex web of culture, language, religion and politics is best manifested in the arts of the region. How does visual culture reflect regional variations? How does a survey of artistic style and iconography help uncover networks of exchange across South Asia? What role did the arts play in the expression of religious traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Islam? With these questions in mind, this course is designed as a survey of the arts of South Asia starting with the height of the Indus Valley Civilization in 2600 BCE and ending in 1857 CE, a date that marks the cessation of independent rule in South Asia. Using the study of architecture, painting, sculpture and textiles, students will learn how to make stylistic and iconographic analyses, while also improving their art historical writing and analytic skills.","enrolmentPreferences":"First years, sophomores and juniors","crossListing":["ARTH 105","ASIA 105"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022394","department":"ASIA","number":111,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1878,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"The Asia-Pacific War","titleShort":"Asia-Pacific War","instructors":[{"id":13626,"name":"Viktor Shmagin"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Weekly meetings with professor and one peer partner; 5-page papers (6 total); 2-page critiques of partner's papers (6 total)","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"The \"Asia-Pacific War,\" as it is known in Japan, raged from the full-scale Japanese invasion of China in 1937 until Japan's total defeat in 1945.

Using the literary techniques of social realism, the novel chronicles the life of a young rural woman from 1961 to 2001. Spring Grass, the protagonist of the novel, was born in a rural village to a mother who preferred sons over daughters. At a young age, Spring Grass was deprived of the opportunity to attend school. Against all odds, she managed to marry for love, venture into the city, and become an enterprising migrant worker. This novel not only reflects the struggles of women in contemporary China but also captures the economic transformation of modern China since 1978 when the Reform and Open-Door Policy (\u003cI\u003egaige kaifang\u003c/I\u003e) was initiated. The novel was adapted into a television drama series and became an instant hit in 2008. This course takes an interdisciplinary, cultural studies and humanistic approach to studying a literary text, using literature as a means to help students better understand social and cultural issues. Through close readings of the novel, the eponymous TV drama series, documentaries, and films depicting rural life and women's roles in China, as well as in-depth discussions of both primary and secondary sources that deal with the cultural, historical, and socioeconomic background of the unfolding story of Spring Grass, this course aims to provide a window for students to examine the issues of inequality in the Chinese village and society at large. Why would mothers be harsh to their own daughters and bar girls' right to education? Why would young people leave their village and migrate to the city? Why would migrant workers leave their children behind in the village? Why would economic developments in China exacerbate the problem of gender inequality in society? Why would the ideology and cultural logic behind Mao Zedong's proclamation \"women can hold up half of the sky\" add more burden to women rather than truly liberate them? Why would city people discriminate against country folks? After taking this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the issues related to gender inequality (\u003cI\u003enannü bu pingdeng\u003c/I\u003e) and the urban/rural-gap (\u003cI\u003echengxiang chabie\u003c/I\u003e) in China.

Though the emphasis of the course is on linguistic description and analysis, there will also be an applied component, as part of which we'll learn several dozen common expressions in each language. Some of the questions to be discussed are: What are the similarities and differences among these three languages? How are and how aren't they related? How did the modern standard form of each develop and what is its relationship to any non-standard languages or dialects? How do these three languages reflect sociolinguistic phenomena such as gender, class, and politeness? How do the writing systems of these languages function and what is the role of Chinese characters in them? What has been the influence of Classical Chinese on Modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean? How have these languages changed due to influence from English and other languages? How are they used in Asian American speech communities? And what are the prospects for their future development, including the influence of computers and digital communications? While this course is not intended as a comprehensive introduction to linguistics, it does introduce many basic terms and concepts from that discipline.","enrolmentPreferences":"Open to all with preference to first-year students and sophomores as well as majors/concentrators in CHIN, JAPN, EALC, ANTH, ASIA and GBST","crossListing":["CHIN 162","GBST 162","ANTH 162","ASIA 162"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010791","department":"ASIA","number":195,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1247,"consent":"I","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Elementary Korean","titleShort":"Elementary Korean","instructors":[{"id":0,"name":"Shaina Adams-El Guabli"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"Twice-Weekly Review Sessions","classReqEval":"Written and oral mid-term and final exam.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Sophomore or higher standing with a GPA of 3.0 or higher; application to the Self-Instructional Languages Program in April.","departmentNotes":"Minimum of two students, plus contracted tutor/examiner in order to schedule the course","descriptionSearch":"\u003cB\u003eInterested students must complete an application through the Self-Instructional Languages Program and have it approved before registering for this course.\u003c/B\u003e Introduction to the alphabet and language structure with emphasis on communicative skills.

These are some of the key questions that the school of thought that has come to be known as \"Confucianism\" addresses.

Although Asian theatres have been studied systematically in the West for at least a century, the West has never truly left its \"othering\" look at them. Yet, what is \"different\" for the West is bedrock for Asian cultures. Theatre, one of the most important and dynamic forms of cultural production and communication, has actively involved all strata of Asian societies for a millennium. How to explain theatre's continued presence and relevance for Asian nations? What do the traditions of Kun, Noh, and Talchum reveal about the cultures and communities in which they were created? This course seeks to understand from the Asian perspective, rather than \"exoticize\" and \"other,\" musical and dance theatres from China, Japan, and Korea. Examining the evolving presentations of signature dramas dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, we will act out Asian theatres in the following ways: (1) by reading the original plays in translation in tandem with their contemporary and intercultural reproductions, we will explore how Asian theatres fare in the era of globalization within and beyond national borders; (2) by revealing the \"technologies\" of writing, reading, acting, and staging these plays in different cultural milieus, we will consider what kinds of language and rhetoric, forms of music and movement, as well as visual components are deployed to convey evolving messages; (3) by considering key performances held outside of the proscenium stage, we will gain exposure to alternative theatrical spaces in Asian and diasporic communities that reform performing conventions, reconfigure staging environments, and renegotiate cultural values. In this manner, we will together gain an appreciation for the aesthetic devices, thematic concerns, and production politics of East Asian theatres and their global reproductions. Class materials include drama, production videos, and invited zoom sessions with Asian theatre practitioners and directors who live in the U.S. and other diasporic communities.

Commanding unprecedented resources and administering a population of 100 to 150 million at its zenith--much larger than any European empire in the early modern world--the Mughals established a centralized administration, with a vast complex of personnel, money, and information networks. Mughal emperors were also political and cultural innovators of global repute. Moreover, while the Mughal dynasty was brought to an end with British colonial rule over India in 1857, the Mughal administrative structures and cultural influences continued to have a lasting impact on the British and later Indian states that followed. Centered around the intersection of the themes of power, patronage of art and architecture and religion, this course will ask: What factors contributed to the durability of the Mughal Empire for three centuries? How did global trade and innovations in taxation contribute to its wealth and stability? How did this dynasty of Muslim monarchs rule over diverse, and largely non-Muslim populations? How did they combine Persian cultural elements with regional ones to establish an empire that was truly Indian in nature? How were the Mughals viewed in their contemporary world of gunpowder empires like the Safavids of Persia and the Ottomans of Turkey? Readings will include the best of the recent scholarship on this vastly influential empire and a rich collection of primary sources, including emperor's memoirs, accounts of European travelers, and racy biographies, which will allow students make their own analysis. They will also have the opportunity to interpret paintings (some of which are held in the WCMA collections) and architecture.

In this course, we will take up the theme of separation as a privileged point of entry into postcolonial literature and towards understanding the multiple meanings of \"postcoloniality.\" We will encounter examples in which this theme shapes critical thought and helps imagine new modes of existence, as well as those in which the grief of separation shades into such overpowering melancholy that writing becomes impossible. We will also look at what the preoccupation with separation can tell us about the ways human beings relate to human and non-human objects, and how they make and experience history.

One the most recognizable features of this system was the treaty \u003cI\u003eport\u003c/I\u003e--an urban center designated as open to foreign residence, trade, and shipping. Extending from an initial five open ports to nearly fifty by the turn of the century, these ports became commercial and industrial centers that connected China to the global economy and created novel spaces of culture, labor, society, and politics. In this research seminar, we will use of several recent online collections of English-language primary source material to investigate the role of the treaty system and the treaty ports in modern Chinese history. The seminar will begin with an exploration of the historiography of the treaty system and \"foreign presence\" and culminate in an original research paper on a related topic of each student's choice. Throughout, we will work on general and specific research methods.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior History majors, History majors, Asian Studies concentrators","crossListing":["ASIA 417","HIST 417"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010577","department":"ASIA","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1696,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Asian Studies","titleShort":"Senior Thesis: Asian Studies","instructors":[{"id":1992,"name":"Anne Reinhardt"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"The grade for the thesis will be determined by the thesis advisor and a faculty reader.

Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter all through their lifetimes, from their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject as they evolve, and to their final fates as they shed their outer layers, whether as planetary nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the products of the stars' nuclear fusion. Interpreting the emission from this interstellar gas is one of astronomers' most powerful tools to measure the physical conditions, motions, and composition of our own galaxy and others. In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms, from cold, dense, star-forming molecular clouds to X-ray-emitting bubbles formed by supernovae. We will learn about the physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe, including radiative ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of \"forbidden\" lines, collisional ionization, and synchrotron radiation. Applying our understanding of these processes, we will analyze the physical conditions and chemical compositions of a variety of nebulae. Finally, we will discuss the evolution of interstellar material in galaxies across cosmic time. This course is observing-intensive. Throughout the semester, students will work in small groups to design, carry out, analyze, and critique their own observations of the interstellar medium taken using the rooftop telescope.","enrolmentPreferences":"Juniors and seniors","crossListing":["ASTR 402"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021305","department":"ASTR","number":404,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3259,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Unsolved Problems In Galaxy Evolution","titleShort":"Galaxy Evolution","instructors":[{"id":19,"name":"Anne Jaskot"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":false,"div3":true,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Student's papers, responses to the partner's papers, and problem sets","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"ASTR 111 and PHYS 142 or 151 or permission of instructor","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"In this tutorial, we will learn about galaxies and their evolution by focusing on some of the key mysteries astronomers are trying to solve.

Social issues are inextricably bound to human ecologies and their environmental settings. Each section of the course provides the science behind the issues and ends with options for possible solutions, which are debated by the class. The course highlights differences between the tropics and areas at higher latitudes while also emphasizing global interconnectedness. It begins with a survey of the tropical environment, including a global climate model, variation in tropical climates and the amazing biodiversity of tropical biomes. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria, AIDS and Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The final part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological environment, and global climate change. This course fulfills the DPE requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social and environmental issues and policies from the perspective of biologists. This builds a framework for lifelong exploration of human diversity in terms of difference, power and equity.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference will be given to Environmental Studies majors/concentrators, students in need of a Division III or DPE requirement, and then Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, and First Year students.","crossListing":["BIOL 134","ENVI 134"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010615","department":"BIOL","number":202,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1027,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Genetics","titleShort":"Genetics","instructors":[{"id":9488,"name":"David W.

These molecules are not simply the products of the proteome nor a collection of cellular fuels and wastes. In this seminar, we will investigate metabolites as signals that influence cellular processes. Biochemistry and molecular biology textbooks often emphasize the proteins that mediate cellular communication. Of course, specialized metabolites like neurotransmitters and certain hormones are well known to regulate information flow between cells. But what about molecules that participate in the metabolic processes of almost every cell--how can these intermediary metabolites be used as signals? How do they communicate acutely and with specificity? What role do they play in sensing (or promoting) environmental change? And how can metabolites be regulated to override their typical fates in metabolic pathways and serve as signals? We'll examine these questions and more at the levels of inter-organellar, intercellular, and inter-organismal metabolic communication by reading the primary scientific literature together.

How does the nervous system mediate behavioral change that occurs in seconds, hours, months, or millions of years? In this course we will use a comparative approach to explore how neural circuits control behavioral flexibility over a range of timescales. We will first discuss circuits that control behavioral switches that occur very rapidly based on environmental and social stimuli. Next, we will consider the role that internal state and identity play in modulating neuronal circuits over an organism's lifetime to influence behavioral decisions. Finally, we will examine how evolution tinkers with neural circuits to lead to behavioral change over very long timescales. Throughout the course we will explore how modifications to neural circuits--including connectivity, synaptic plasticity, neuromodulation and neuron physiology--can lead to differences in behavior and ask if there are connections between common mechanisms underlying behavioral change across timescales.

The intensity of the scientific investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has not yet materialized, and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now four decades into the AIDS pandemic, and the World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 38 million HIV-infected persons worldwide. After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system and discuss strategies for developing an effective HIV vaccine.","enrolmentPreferences":"Seniors, juniors, sophomores, then first-year students","crossListing":["CHEM 115","STS 115"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022372","department":"CHEM","number":200,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3116,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Advanced Chemical Concepts","titleShort":"Advanced Chemical Concepts","instructors":[{"id":9481,"name":"Anthony J.

Our focus in this course will be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though some attention will also be paid to written Cantonese, including the special characters which have been used for centuries to write colloquial Cantonese, which have become even more widely used in Hong Kong since 1997. Since students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a rather closely related language, they should be able to attain in one semester approximately the same proficiency level that is attained in the first two semesters of Mandarin.","enrolmentPreferences":"Chinese and East Asian Languages \u0026 Cultures majors as well as Asian Studies concentrators","crossListing":["ASIA 130","CHIN 131"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021845","department":"CHIN","number":162,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3283,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Languages Of East Asia","titleShort":"Languages Of East Asia","instructors":[{"id":1836,"name":"Cornelius C.

Though the emphasis of the course is on linguistic description and analysis, there will also be an applied component, as part of which we'll learn several dozen common expressions in each language. Some of the questions to be discussed are: What are the similarities and differences among these three languages? How are and how aren't they related? How did the modern standard form of each develop and what is its relationship to any non-standard languages or dialects? How do these three languages reflect sociolinguistic phenomena such as gender, class, and politeness? How do the writing systems of these languages function and what is the role of Chinese characters in them? What has been the influence of Classical Chinese on Modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean? How have these languages changed due to influence from English and other languages? How are they used in Asian American speech communities? And what are the prospects for their future development, including the influence of computers and digital communications? While this course is not intended as a comprehensive introduction to linguistics, it does introduce many basic terms and concepts from that discipline.","enrolmentPreferences":"Open to all with preference to first-year students and sophomores as well as majors/concentrators in CHIN, JAPN, EALC, ANTH, ASIA and GBST","crossListing":["ANTH 162","ASIA 162","CHIN 162","GBST 162"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022325","department":"CHIN","number":200,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1266,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Accelerated Chinese On Special Topics For Heritage Speakers","titleShort":"Chinese For Heritage Speakers","instructors":[{"id":1861,"name":"Cecilia Chang"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"Semi-Tutorial Format, Students Will Meet As A Large Group In Most Weeks For Linguistic Development And Two-To-Three-People Groups In Some Weeks For Project-Based Discussions.","classReqEval":"Active participation in class, homework, quizzes, essays, oral presentations, and a final project","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Students must complete the Chinese Placement Evaluation in GLOW before registering for this course","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course is tailor designed for students who already possess intermediate-level proficiency in speaking Chinese but lack the basic reading and writing skills, commonly referred to as heritage speakers of Chinese.

What constitutes human nature and does it tend towards good or evil? How should we organize society, by focusing on laws and regulations, or on ritual and moral guidance? What is the nature of moral rulership? What is the proper relationship between the individual and larger units of society, from the family to the state? These are some of the key questions that the school of thought that has come to be known as \"Confucianism\" addresses. As the dominant moral and political philosophy for thousands of years in much of East Asia, Confucianism has shaped our world, past and present, in innumerable ways. In this class we will focus on the foundational texts of the Confucian tradition: the \u003cI\u003eAnalects\u003c/I\u003e (purported to record the words of Confucius himself), \u003cI\u003eMengzi\u003c/I\u003e (often romanized as \"Mencius\"), and \u003cI\u003eXunzi\u003c/I\u003e.

Although Asian theatres have been studied systematically in the West for at least a century, the West has never truly left its \"othering\" look at them. Yet, what is \"different\" for the West is bedrock for Asian cultures. Theatre, one of the most important and dynamic forms of cultural production and communication, has actively involved all strata of Asian societies for a millennium. How to explain theatre's continued presence and relevance for Asian nations? What do the traditions of Kun, Noh, and Talchum reveal about the cultures and communities in which they were created? This course seeks to understand from the Asian perspective, rather than \"exoticize\" and \"other,\" musical and dance theatres from China, Japan, and Korea. Examining the evolving presentations of signature dramas dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, we will act out Asian theatres in the following ways: (1) by reading the original plays in translation in tandem with their contemporary and intercultural reproductions, we will explore how Asian theatres fare in the era of globalization within and beyond national borders; (2) by revealing the \"technologies\" of writing, reading, acting, and staging these plays in different cultural milieus, we will consider what kinds of language and rhetoric, forms of music and movement, as well as visual components are deployed to convey evolving messages; (3) by considering key performances held outside of the proscenium stage, we will gain exposure to alternative theatrical spaces in Asian and diasporic communities that reform performing conventions, reconfigure staging environments, and renegotiate cultural values. In this manner, we will together gain an appreciation for the aesthetic devices, thematic concerns, and production politics of East Asian theatres and their global reproductions. Class materials include drama, production videos, and invited zoom sessions with Asian theatre practitioners and directors who live in the U.S. and other diasporic communities.

Using the literary techniques of social realism, the novel chronicles the life of a young rural woman from 1961 to 2001. Spring Grass, the protagonist of the novel, was born in a rural village to a mother who preferred sons over daughters. At a young age, Spring Grass was deprived of the opportunity to attend school. Against all odds, she managed to marry for love, venture into the city, and become an enterprising migrant worker. This novel not only reflects the struggles of women in contemporary China but also captures the economic transformation of modern China since 1978 when the Reform and Open-Door Policy (\u003cI\u003egaige kaifang\u003c/I\u003e) was initiated. The novel was adapted into a television drama series and became an instant hit in 2008. This course takes an interdisciplinary, cultural studies and humanistic approach to studying a literary text, using literature as a means to help students better understand social and cultural issues. Through close readings of the novel, the eponymous TV drama series, documentaries, and films depicting rural life and women's roles in China, as well as in-depth discussions of both primary and secondary sources that deal with the cultural, historical, and socioeconomic background of the unfolding story of Spring Grass, this course aims to provide a window for students to examine the issues of inequality in the Chinese village and society at large. Why would mothers be harsh to their own daughters and bar girls' right to education? Why would young people leave their village and migrate to the city? Why would migrant workers leave their children behind in the village? Why would economic developments in China exacerbate the problem of gender inequality in society? Why would the ideology and cultural logic behind Mao Zedong's proclamation \"women can hold up half of the sky\" add more burden to women rather than truly liberate them? Why would city people discriminate against country folks?

First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception.

Embodied in satyrs, sphinxes, centaurs, nymphs, and other part-human, part-animal beings is an alternative evolutionary and cultural history. In it, humans and animals live as one. There is no distinction between nature and culture. Male and female are equal. The industrial revolution never happens. This course traces the history of interspecies beings from their origin in ancient Greek art and poetry until today. Three points are important: 1) the relationship between the imagery and ancient political theory about \"primitive\" life; 2) evolving conceptions of biology and the environment, and 3) the role played by interspecies beings in the conceptualization of what is possible in art. The first half of the course examines the origins and character of interspecies beings in works of ancient art such as the Parthenon, and in ancient writers including Hesiod and Ovid. We examine relevant religious practices, materialist conceptions of nature, and biological theories of speciation, in Empedokles, On nature, Euripides' Bakchai, Plato's Phaidros, and Lucretius' De rerum natura. The second half of the course investigates the survival of classical monsters in the work of early-modern artists such as Botticelli, Michelangelo, Titian, and Dürer, and the rediscovery of ancient materialist theory. We consider the role played by interspecies beings in the formation of late modernism in art and literature. Key texts include Rousseau and Hobbes, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, Mallarmé's \"L'Apres midi d'une faun,\" and Stoppard's Arcadia. Problems include the relationship between nymphs and sex-workers in Manet, the meaning of the Minotaur in Picasso, and the interest in interspecies beings in the work of women surrealists such as Leonora Carrington. We conclude with contemporary popular culture such as the Hunger Games.","enrolmentPreferences":"Priority goes to graduate students in art history.

Along the way we will discuss principles of syntax, the sub-field that studies sentence structures, and pragmatics, the sub-field that studies inferences of non-literal content. This is a formal course, but no prior logical or mathematical background will be expected. Starting from scratch, students will learn the building blocks of current-day linguistic research. This introduction will be of use to students interested in language from a variety of perspectives, including philosophy, cognitive science, and computer science.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference given to seniors and philosophy/cognitive science majors.","crossListing":["COGS 224","PHIL 221"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"014338","department":"COGS","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1712,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Advanced Topics In Mind And Cognition","titleShort":"Topics Mind \u0026 Cognition","instructors":[{"id":2160,"name":"Joseph L.

At the same time, Finland fought for its survival, first against the Soviet Union and then against the Nazis, in the boreal forests of its eastern border and the winter snows of its arctic north. In the Atlantic, the Danish colonial territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained insulated from Nazi control in faraway Denmark, but struggled to maintain their autonomy, amid the occupation of their islands by Allied forces. While some Danes and Norwegians (like the writer Knut Hamsun and traitor Vidkun Quisling) collaborated with the Nazis, others risked their lives in the Resistance to carry out sabotage, espionage, and rescue others. Even as hundreds of Norwegian Jews were deported and murdered in Auschwitz, thousands of Danish Jews escaped to neutral Sweden with the help of their neighbors. Some Scandinavians continued this struggle beyond Nordic borders, like the Swedish diplomats Raoul Wallenberg (who saved thousands of European Jews in Budapest) and Raoul Nordling (whose careful diplomacy saved the city of Paris from total destruction). In this course, we will examine some of the most powerful literature and film on Scandinavia and World War II, and their representation of soldiers and civilians, invasion and occupation, collaboration and resistance, atrocities and genocide, cruelty and courage, survival and sacrifice. \u003cI\u003eAll readings and discussions in English\u003c/I\u003e.","enrolmentPreferences":"Comparative Literature Majors, and those with compelling justification for admission.","crossListing":["COMP 218"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021327","department":"COMP","number":220,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3532,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Greek Tragedy","titleShort":"Greek Tragedy","instructors":[{"id":10250,"name":"Sarah E.

Known as the \"war to end (all) war(s),\" World War I set the stage for an entire century of military conflict and carnage. New technologies led to unprecedented violence in the trenches, killing and wounding as many as 41 million soldiers and civilians. Beyond the slaughter at the front, the Great War also led to the global influenza pandemic that claimed up to 50 million lives, and the Armenian genocide that presaged the later atrocities of the Holocaust. The war also led to massive political transformation, from the Irish Rebellion and Russian Revolution, to the collapse of the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires, and the redrawing of national borders across Europe and the Middle East. Even the end of the war with the Treaty of Versailles lay the groundwork for new animosities that would lead to the Second World War just two decades later. However, the First World War also inspired great social change, from the emergence of the United States as a global leader and the founding of the League of Nations, to growing discontent with colonial rule in Asia and Africa, and greater power for women whose wartime labor influenced the post-war passage of their right to vote in countries across Europe and North America. In our study of the Great War, we will examine texts and films that bear witness to the suffering and courage of soldiers and civilians, and consider the legacy of the war in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries.

What is it about outdoor swimming pools that they irremediably capture our imagination?\nThis interdisciplinary tutorial explores the function and significance of outdoor swimming pools in French, German, and U.S. culture through literature, painting, photography, and film. Whether we regard them as a symbol of status and wealth, the remnants of Hollywood's Golden Age era, the embodiment of order and discipline, or a major environmental impact factor, they nevertheless fascinate us. Because outdoor swimming pools, whether private or public, are a microcosm of society and a metaphor for human civilization, they have also been at the center of discussions about racial segregation and religious discrimination in Europe as well as in the U.S.A.. Although pools are mostly governed by tacit rules, such as respect for personal space and the desexualization of encounters, visitors have often disregarded and broken these regulations. That explains why outdoor swimming pools have often served as the perfect backdrop for literature and cinema's steamiest and most violent scenes.\nWe will start the course with a brief social history of pools and read a few sociological studies of swimming pools by experts (Jeff Wiltse, Kate Moles, Susie Scott) to lay the theoretical ground for our analysis. In the course of the tutorial, we will explore through novels, photographs, paintings, and films the various functions assigned to outdoor swimming pools depending on the time period. We will also delve into the genre of summer pool side literature (the satirical \u003cI\u003eSummer House with Swimming Pool \u003c/I\u003e(2011) by Hermann Koch, the thriller \u003cI\u003eThe Swimming Pool\u003c/I\u003e (2018) by Clare Mackintosh, and Julie Otsuka's latest novel, \u003cI\u003eThe Swimmers \u003c/I\u003e\u003cI\u003e(2022))\u003c/I\u003e and try to explain its great popularity.\nWhile the outdoor pool functions as a mirror of excess and decadence in the 1920's as evidenced by the lavish pool parties thrown by \u003cI\u003eThe Great Gatsby \u003c/I\u003eby F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925), it becomes the epitome of white middleclass suburban life in the 60's as John Cheever's short story \u003cI\u003eThe Swimmer\u003c/I\u003e narrates. During the 1970's, the pool advances as a symbol of sexual liberation as the erotic thriller \u003cI\u003eThe Swimming Pool\u003c/I\u003e (France, 1969) by Jacques Deray, the sexually charged pool paintings \u003cI\u003ePeter Getting Out of Nick's Pool\u003c/I\u003e \u003cI\u003e(1966) \u003c/I\u003e\u003cI\u003eor\u003c/I\u003e\u003cI\u003e Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u003c/I\u003e (1972) by David Hockney, or the male nudes by Tom Bianchi in his \u003cI\u003eFire Island Pines: Poloroids\u003c/I\u003e \u003cI\u003e1975-1983\u003c/I\u003e attest. In the 1980's the outdoor pool becomes once more the mirror of opulence and eroticism, which Helmut Newton's photographs of Hollywood celebrities (Liz Taylor swimming in her jewels) and for Playboy magazine capture as well as Paul Thomas Anderson's film \u003cI\u003eBoogie Nights\u003c/I\u003e (U.S.A.,1997) about the booming porn industry during the Reagan-era. Starting in the late 90's, the outdoor swimming pool takes on greater political significance, largely due to the emergence and increasing visibility of female and gay filmmakers. In François Ozon's thriller \u003cI\u003eSwimming Pool\u003c/I\u003e (France, 1996), the pool is the setting of female solidarity and feminist revenge. In her character study movie \u003cI\u003eEveryone else\u003c/I\u003e (Germany, 2009), Maren Ade carefully examines how gender roles and stereotypes play out and get reinforced during a pool party. At last, in her recent comedy \u003cI\u003eFreibad\u003c/I\u003e, (Germany, 2022) Doris Dorrie chooses a women-only public outdoor pool as the backdrop to raise questions of racial segregation and religious discrimination","enrolmentPreferences":"Freshmen, sophomores, and juniors","crossListing":["COMP 227"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020980","department":"COMP","number":234,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1172,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Saharan Imaginations","titleShort":"Saharan Imaginations","instructors":[{"id":10244,"name":"Brahim El Guabli"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active participation, short presentation, short weekly responses on GLOW, midterm exam, and final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Deconstructing reductive Saharanism, which the course conceptualizes as a universalizing discourse about deserts, this course seeks to critically examine the myriad assumptions that are projected upon deserts across times and cultures.

Cultural production, particularly literature and film, do, however, furnish a critical space in which important questions can be raised about deserts' fundamental importance to different cultures and societies. Drawing on novels, films, and secondary scholarship, the course will help students understand how myth, memory, history, coloniality/postcoloniality, and a strong sense of ethics are deeply intertwined in the desert sub-genre of African, Euro-American, and Middle Eastern literatures. Whether grappling with transcontinental issues of climate change, cannibalization of biodiversity or overexploitation of natural resources, desert-focused cultural production invites us to interrogate the politics of space and place as well as mobility and spatial control as they relate to this supposedly dead nature.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students are admitted into the course on a first-come-first-serve basis.

Such is the challenge of \"understanding\" the traditions of the absurd. In this tutorial course, we will engage this challenge within the realm of Western theatre and performance from 1900 to the present. Beginning with selected readings from writers who have engaged the absurd in theoretical fashion (Albert Camus, Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Esslin), the course will move swiftly to original artworks for contemplation and analysis. Some questions we will grapple with include: How do we, can we, should we respond to art that specifically defies meaning? Can art that seems pointless have a point?

But what are worlds, anyway? Are they spaces? Or are they not a thing at all, but social systems--ways of belonging that are constantly being made and remade? This course is about the specific world--imagining powers of the novel, tracing out various techniques and strategies by which literary texts create worlds. Our hunch: the modern notion of \"world\" finds its origin in the novel, and the novel constitutes one of the most sophisticated sites of reflection upon that notion. We'll read a number of novels, ranging from 19th-century authors like Austen and Dickens, to contemporary genre writing--science fiction and the detective novel--to see how novels, and ideas of world, shift over time and space. To get at our central questions, we'll read some philosophical and critical texts preoccupied by world-ness, consider the colonial contexts of some novel worlds, and engage contemporary debates around the possibilities of \"World Literature.\" Likely authors include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, Italo Calvino, and China Mieville.","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomores and first-year students","crossListing":["COMP 268","ENGL 263"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022277","department":"COMP","number":270,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3168,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Divas And Dervishes: Introduction To Modern Arab Music And Performance","titleShort":"Arab Music And Performance","instructors":[{"id":12792,"name":"Nicholas R Mangialardi"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In-class participation, short essays (1 page) every two weeks, midterm presentation, and a final paper (12-14 pages).","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"From Sufi rituals to revolutionary uprisings, music has long played a central role in the social, political, and religious life of the Arab world.

Although Asian theatres have been studied systematically in the West for at least a century, the West has never truly left its \"othering\" look at them. Yet, what is \"different\" for the West is bedrock for Asian cultures. Theatre, one of the most important and dynamic forms of cultural production and communication, has actively involved all strata of Asian societies for a millennium. How to explain theatre's continued presence and relevance for Asian nations? What do the traditions of Kun, Noh, and Talchum reveal about the cultures and communities in which they were created? This course seeks to understand from the Asian perspective, rather than \"exoticize\" and \"other,\" musical and dance theatres from China, Japan, and Korea. Examining the evolving presentations of signature dramas dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, we will act out Asian theatres in the following ways: (1) by reading the original plays in translation in tandem with their contemporary and intercultural reproductions, we will explore how Asian theatres fare in the era of globalization within and beyond national borders; (2) by revealing the \"technologies\" of writing, reading, acting, and staging these plays in different cultural milieus, we will consider what kinds of language and rhetoric, forms of music and movement, as well as visual components are deployed to convey evolving messages; (3) by considering key performances held outside of the proscenium stage, we will gain exposure to alternative theatrical spaces in Asian and diasporic communities that reform performing conventions, reconfigure staging environments, and renegotiate cultural values. In this manner, we will together gain an appreciation for the aesthetic devices, thematic concerns, and production politics of East Asian theatres and their global reproductions.

But we live under a different regime. What now is the difference between work and leisure for those working \"gigs\"?

When riots, censorship, trials, and vilification greet such works in moments of political and social upheaval, the public outrage is often strangely out of proportion to either the work's aesthetic nature or its overt commentary on the political crisis. Something powerfully symptomatic is at work, then: a set of threatened investments, unacknowledged values, and repressed ideas which surface explosively, but indirectly, in the aesthetic outrage. In an attempt to understand the strange logic of public outrage against works of art, we will explore the respective works' historical contexts, and use theoretical models--aesthetic, political, psychological, social--as a means of illuminating the dynamics of outrage and exposing understated linkages between a work's figurative logic and the political passions of its historical moment. We will study instances of outrage in the context of the French Revolution (Beaumarchais' \u003cI\u003eThe Marriage of Figaro\u003c/I\u003e), the wave of anarchist terrorism in turn-of-the-century Paris (Jarry's \u003cI\u003eUbu the King\u003c/I\u003e), the trials of Oscar Wilde for \"gross indecency\" (\u003cI\u003eThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u003c/I\u003e), the Irish Revolution (Synge's \u003cI\u003eThe Playboy of the Western World\u003c/I\u003e and O'Casey's \u003cI\u003eThe Plough and the Stars\u003c/I\u003e), and Stalinist collectivization (Eisenstein's suppressed film \u003cI\u003eBezhin Meadow\u003c/I\u003e).

In a century dominated by the devastation of two World Wars, the atrocities of colonial empire, and massive social and political transformation, the novel both documented and interrogated France's engagement with race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, colonialism and immigration.

Instead of searching for an answer at the movement's supposed point of origin (1790-1830, in Germany, England, and France), we will begin in early twentieth-century South Asia. In the nineteenth century, English Romantic poetry and, to a lesser extent, ethico-political and aesthetic ideas associated with German Idealism circulated in South Asia as part of a colonial education aimed at producing \"a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect\" (Macaulay). The intentions of this plan of education aside, it unwittingly opened channels for literary, philosophical, and political exchange that were harmful to colonial rule, and essential to how we understand worlds of literature today. Behind the backs of its homegrown, self-anointed inheritors, Romanticism in the \"colonies\" led multiple other lives and was transformed in encounters that must--belatedly--be read back into its originary texts. Hence, in counter-chronological fashion, in this class we will begin with important postcolonial works by Faiz Ahmad Faiz (Urdu), Suryakant Tripathi Nirala (Hindi), Mahadevi Verma (Hindi), Sarojini Naidu (English), Mohammad Iqbal (Urdu and Persian), and Rabindranath Tagore (Bengali), to move on to Karl Marx and Heinrichs Heine (German), Charles Baudelaire (French), and George Eliot (English), to end with John Keats (English), William Wordsworth (English), and G.W.F. Hegel (German). In considering these texts with an eye to poetics and interpretation, we will pay close attention to concepts that they bring to the fore, key among them \"belatedness\" (Nachträglichkeit), \"allegory\", \"critique,\" \"non-identity.\" We will read non-English language texts in translation, though we will have occasion to discuss originals.","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors, then sophomores considering the major","crossListing":["COMP 327","ENGL 324"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019791","department":"COMP","number":331,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1872,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"The Brothers Karamazov","titleShort":"The Brothers Karamazov","instructors":[{"id":2161,"name":"Julie A.

Is religious faith possible in an age of reason, science, and technology? Can man's earthly laws ever carry out divine justice? Is humanity prepared to bear the burden of responsibility that comes with freedom? This tutorial will spend an entire semester exploring Dostoevsky's masterwork, and we will read a variety of secondary sources alongside \u003cI\u003eThe Brothers Karamazov\u003c/I\u003e, including history, philosophy, and literary theory.

In this course, we will take up the theme of separation as a privileged point of entry into postcolonial literature and towards understanding the multiple meanings of \"postcoloniality.\" We will encounter examples in which this theme shapes critical thought and helps imagine new modes of existence, as well as those in which the grief of separation shades into such overpowering melancholy that writing becomes impossible. We will also look at what the preoccupation with separation can tell us about the ways human beings relate to human and non-human objects, and how they make and experience history. To think through these issues, we will read nineteenth and twentieth century works dealing with experiences of love, ecstasy, migrancy, exile, and slavery, composed in diverse geographical, socio-political, and linguistic contexts. We will read works (novels, poems, memoirs, essays) and watch films from South Asia, Egypt, the Caribbeans, the US, and Europe, composed in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, French, Arabic, Bengali and Malyalam).","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors, then sophomores considering the major","crossListing":["ASIA 353","COMP 350","ENGL 352"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"018388","department":"COMP","number":355,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3610,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Contemporary American Theatre: Poetry, Politics, Place","titleShort":"Contemporary American Theatre","instructors":[{"id":2022,"name":"Amy S.

Stories, in this view, are not only the stuff of literature, but also the very fabric of social life: the foundation for individual and collective identities. This course grapples with the role of stories and storytelling in modern social life. What role do stories play in constituting personal identity? What cultural templates structure the stories we tell? Why are memoirs so popular, and how can we explain the more recent resurgence of interest in oral forms of storytelling? What role does storytelling play in politics and social movements? Specific topics will include confessional culture, podcasts, memoir, politics, and social change.

However, the creation of the Alliance Israelite Universelle's schools (1830s), the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the decolonization process in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War accelerated the departure of Arab and Berber Jews from their homelands to other destinations, including France, Israel, Canada, the United States, and different Latin American countries. Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in critical and comparative literary, religious or historical studies.","crossListing":["ARAB 363","COMP 363","JWST 268","REL 268"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022341","department":"COMP","number":378,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3807,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Proust'S \"In Search Of Lost Time\"","titleShort":"Proust'S \"In Search Of Lost Ti","instructors":[{"id":2386,"name":"Stephen J.

The first-person narrative chronicling the life of a fictional figure bearing a close relationship to Proust himself spans several decades from the late 19th to the early 20th century, centering on French high society as it enters the modern world, shaped by historical events such as the Dreyfus Affair and the First World War. Proust's exploration of the consciousness of the protagonist, an aspiring writer, has led readers to see him as a philosopher of aesthetics, of the psyche, of time and memory, and of the nature of desire. His narrative ranges from meditations on such subjects to social satire to absorbing and sometimes soap opera-like plots exploring upward and downward social mobility and a wide array of sexual entanglements, straight and queer. Through his fluent prose, Proust renders the vicissitudes of desire, loss, and joy, of betrayal and emotional intransigence, and tests the power of memory and the imagination to recapture the past. Because of the length of \u003cI\u003eIn Search of Lost Time\u003c/I\u003e, the emphasis of the course will be more on reading (about 7 to 7½ hours per week) and less on writing (four or five 1½-page journal entries and a final paper of 8-10 pages) than the average 300-level course; and approximately one-third of the sequence will be bracketed as optional reading.","enrolmentPreferences":"English, French, and Comparative Literature majors","crossListing":["COMP 378","ENGL 378","RLFR 378"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019670","department":"COMP","number":380,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1559,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Literary And Critical Theory In The Twentieth Century","titleShort":"20th-Century Literary Theory","instructors":[{"id":5727,"name":"Christopher A.

What are the ideas associated with these different movements, and how are they connected?

They are embodied, and they create change through this embodiment. During the summer of 1964, the Motown anthem Dancing In the Street (D.I.T.S.) became a joyful expression of the desire to take up space, in tune with the powerful political and social justice movements of the time. D.I.T.S. continues to be sung by contemporary artists as an expression of celebration and as a call to action, highlighting the cyclical nature of time and experience. What brought people into the streets in communities across the globe in 1964, in 2020, and beyond? With this question in mind, we will examine, discuss, and respond to the ways in which artistic expression can document lived experiences, and deploy similar tactics to explore and document our present lives. How have artists documented and driven forward major themes in social justice, both in the past and in our current times?\nA primary focus of consideration will be the anti-lynching movement across time, which has given rise to the art and aesthetics of the Civil Rights, Black Lives Matter, and Say Her Name Movements. Grounding this work will be a deep exploration of \"Strange Fruit,\" an artistic tour de force that began life as a poem in response to a photographic image and grew to encompass dance, visual art, theatre, media, and music--particularly the enduring and repeating renditions by artists like Billie Holiday, Pearl Primus, and Nina Simone.\nThe course trajectory will also be deeply affected by the students who take part, offering their own stories and experiences in conversation with the work of influential creative practitioners. Inspired by our own origin stories and the roll call of cities heard in D.I.T.S., we will consider the ways in which dance, music, theatre, visual art and other forms of creative expression are made to be shared, causing culture and experiences to bear witness and become meaningful beyond the boundaries of origin. Course meetings will include viewings and discussions of creative expression in various media and formats through an ethnographic performance studies lens, further examining the role of the artist as witness/documentarian, activist, and agent of change. This work will serve as a catalyst in the production of original performance offerings (solo and group-based) that will be shared with a public audience.","enrolmentPreferences":"An interest in the arts, performance studies, popular culture, history, and/or experience in social dance, music, theatre, writing or visual art making.

They are embodied, and they create change through this embodiment. During the summer of 1964, the Motown anthem Dancing In the Street (D.I.T.S.) became a joyful expression of the desire to take up space, in tune with the powerful political and social justice movements of the time. D.I.T.S. continues to be sung by contemporary artists as an expression of celebration and as a call to action, highlighting the cyclical nature of time and experience. What brought people into the streets in communities across the globe in 1964, in 2020, and beyond? With this question in mind, we will examine, discuss, and respond to the ways in which artistic expression can document lived experiences, and deploy similar tactics to explore and document our present lives. How have artists documented and driven forward major themes in social justice, both in the past and in our current times? How do artists and their work document and comment on the past, embody the present, and perform the future into existence?\nA primary focus of consideration will be the use of storytelling as a vehicle for artistic expression that connects people and ideas across time and space. When Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five drop \"The Message\" in 1982, the Bronx is burning, and the birth of Hip-Hop has people returning to the streets. Disco's velvet rope comes down and urban America comes together to celebrate the life they can live, aspire toward a life they want to live, and spread the word about the realities they face along the way. The cypher creates space for verse, hooks, samples, and dance, and the world becomes a canvas as graffiti artists work to claim space and contribute to a new canon. With global urban music like Hip-Hop, Reggae, and Afrobeat as a backdrop, we will examine the impact of vernacular African American dance and music, and its presence in various performance traditions.\nThe course trajectory will also be deeply affected by the students who take part, offering their own stories and experiences in conversation with the work of influential creative practitioners. Inspired by our own origin stories and the roll call of cities heard in D.I.T.S., we will consider the ways in which dance, music, theatre, visual art and other forms of creative expression are made to be shared, causing culture and experiences to bear witness and become meaningful beyond the boundaries of origin. Course meetings will include viewings and discussions of creative expression in various media and formats through an ethnographic performance studies lens, further examining the role of the artist as witness/documentarian, activist, and agent of change. This work will serve as a catalyst in the production of original performance offerings (solo and group-based) that will be shared.\nWe will examine how dancers/choreographers: Rosie Perez, Fatima Robinson, and Rennie Harris use dance and media to tell personal stories and document public events. Musicians/performers: Dr. Dre, James Brown, Beyonce, Public Enemy, Kendrick Lamar and visual artists: Carrie Mae Weems, Titus Kaphar, Hank Willis are creators whose work will be referenced. Writers and poets: Jeff Chang, Gregory Tate, Tricia Rose, Suheir Hammad, Gill Scott-Herron, Mayda del Valle\nWhat questions are artists posing? What statements are they making? What can be made that responds to this work and that reflects your own stories?\nCourse meetings will include:\n1. Weekly movement and listening sessions that embody the Hip Hop aesthetic\n2. Weekly discussion of readings, media and other course materials\n3. Making a solo or a collaborative project during the semester to be shared as a final project","enrolmentPreferences":"An interest in the arts, performance studies, popular culture, history, and/or experience in social dance, music, theatre, writing or visual art making.

Through movement and rhythm, dancers experience the embodied knowledge of previous generations, while connecting to contemporary cultural, political, and economic realities. Katherine Dunham devoted her life to exploring and exposing the multiple layers and complexities of the African diasporic experience through her ethnographic dance choreographies, her dance technique, her schools, her music, and her writing. Dunham's work as a dance anthropologist, artist, educator, and humanitarian is manifested in Dunham Technique; the technique is a fusion of African diasporic dance, ballet and modern dance, and functions as an embodied medium for cultural communication. The technique is considered \"a way of life\" as it uses theory and philosophy to engage participants in a holistic experience that is not only physical, but also intellectual, emotional, and spiritual. Through this combination of physicality, history, theory, and philosophy, Dunham Technique is a tool to understand one's inner self and place oneself within a historical and cultural framework. In this course, students will explore the history, theory, and philosophies of Dunham Technique and Katherine Dunham, while actively participating with the technique's movement concepts and vocabulary. Students will engage in the fundamentals of a Dunham Technique movement class through center floor work, barre exercises, progressions, and choreography. The course will combine the studio experience of the physical technique with lectures and discussions.

These forms are shaped by the impact of religion, colonialism, national political movements, travel, immigration, and the continuing emergence of technology. In South Africa, the labor conditions of miners instigated the creation of Isicathulo, Gum boots, and in Brazil the history of colonialism is a factor that anchors Samba as a sustaining cultural and socioeconomic force. The birth of Hip Hop in the 20th century finds populations across the globe using its music, dance, lyrics, and swagger as a vehicle for individual and group voice. Hip Hop thrives as a cultural presence in most countries of the African continent and in the Americas. We will examine the factors that moved this form from the Bronx, New York, to Johannesburg, South Africa, and Rio, Brazil. We will examine at least two of these forms learning dance and music technique and composition material that will inform their practice.

While the popularity of these dance styles has expanded and now different groups of people now embrace these movement vocabularies, the practices remain deeply connected to the history and culture of Black folk. Despite the increased popularity of these dances, within Eurocentric aesthetics, the Black dancing body carries the mark of vulgarity and should either be controlled, exploited, and/or exoticized. These dangerous bodies are considered sexually deviant and in need of influence and control through colonialism, imperialism, and religion. Yet, the dancing pelvis, hips, and butt write and document the Black experience. The dancing Black body carries the memories of the diaspora and provides space for the body to experience autonomy. This embodied knowledge, carried by Black bodies, is intertwined with the everyday lives of Black folk. Furthermore, through these practices, Black communities commune, resist dominant narratives, and embrace their humanity. Nevertheless, the pelvis/hips/butt dancing body is not embraced equally among Black people. In the practice of these movement genres, Black communities negotiate matters of respectability, pleasure, and self-actualization.\nThis course is an exploration into the use of the hips, butt, and pelvis in three movement genres: bounce, a genre of hip-hip from New Orleans and origin culture of the term \"twerking\" Black majorette/dance team performance, a jazz and Black social dance infused form that originated from the marching band culture at Historically Black Colleges and Universities; and Caribbean wining, a hip rolling movement performed throughout the Caribbean. Students will engage with scholarship and participate in discussions focused on the individual and communal practice of these traditions. The class community will investigate themes such as respectability politics, the politics of pleasure, and communal organizing to gain a better understanding of these practices. Additionally, students will physically explore these dance traditions and work with guest artists who specialize in these practices. The course will culminate in a public dance party that will be curated and facilitated by the class community.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in expanding their knowledge of African diasporic dance, particularly social dance.","crossListing":["AFR 245","DANC 220"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020515","department":"DANC","number":226,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3576,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Gender And The Dancing Body","titleShort":"Gender And The Dancing Body","instructors":[{"id":8704,"name":"Munjulika R.

Drawing on a broad definition of performance, students will explore everything from writing and painting to sports and dance to inquire how performance reflects, critiques and negotiates migratory experiences in the African diaspora. For example, how did musician Sidney Bechet's migration from New Orleans to Chicago to London influence the early jazz era? How did Katherine Dunham's dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem? What drew actor/singer Paul Robeson to Russia, and why did the U.S. revoke his passport in response to his speeches abroad? These questions will lead students to investigate multiple migrations in the African diasporic experience and aid our exploration of the reasons for migration throughout history and geography.

Drawing from a number of case studies from throughout Africa and the African Diaspora, we will first endeavor to understand and contextualize issues related to education, social uplift, the environment, and the economy as they relate to specific communities. We will then examine how a series of organizations (from grassroots campaigns to multinational initiatives) utilize the performing arts in response to those issues.\nAmong the issues we will discuss at length are:\n-How do performers and organizations navigate the interplay between showcasing the performance talents of individuals and groups and foregrounding an issue or cause? More broadly, what dilemmas emerge as social and aesthetic imperatives intermingle?\n-What are the dynamics between people acting on a local level within their communities and their various international partnerships and audiences?\n-How can government or NGO sponsorship help and/or hinder systemic change?\nBy the end of the semester, students will be equipped with conceptual frameworks and critical vocabularies that can help them ascertain the functions of performance within larger organizations and in service to complex societal issues. Throughout the course, we will watch and listen to a variety of performances from traditional genres to hip-hop, however this class is less about learning to perform or analyze any particular genre than it is about thinking through how performance is used as a vehicle for social change.\nCase studies will include youth outreach and uplift in Tanzania through the United African Alliance, campaigns to promote girls' education in Benin and Zimbabwe, community-wide decolonizing initiatives through the Yole!Africa Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the cultural reclamation of a mining town in Suriname through the arts organization, Stichting Kibii.","enrolmentPreferences":"If the course exceeds the maximum enrollment, selection will be made based on students explanations for why they want to take the class.","crossListing":["DANC 323","MUS 323","THEA 321"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"014053","department":"ECON","number":110,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1756,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Principles Of Microeconomics","titleShort":"Principles Of Microeconomics","instructors":[{"id":5576,"name":"Susan Godlonton"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":true,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Problem sets, quizzes, short essays, two midterms, final exam","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"The department recommends students follow this course with ECON 120 or with a lower-level elective that has ECON 110 as its prerequisite; students may alternatively proceed directly to ECON 251 after taking this introductory course.","descriptionSearch":"This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural resources.

For most of the last century, macroeconomic priorities in developing countries constrained the potential of these policies during crisis periods when governments faced pressure to cut public spending, with adverse consequences for the most vulnerable. However, over the past two decades, developing country governments have increasingly integrated health, education, welfare and employment policies to counter shocks and build economic resilience. These more comprehensive responses proved vital during the COVID-19 crisis's cascading series of epidemiological, economic, social, and political shocks, as public health measures created severe livelihoods disasters for the most vulnerable. In this respect, COVID-19 serves as a harbinger of the future shocks that climate change threatens. This tutorial will focus on how developing country governments can build bridges across vital policy sectors--particularly health, education, welfare and employment--and link these to other economic interventions in order to better tackle future global crises. Building on a historical analysis, the course will examine the path-breaking examples of many developing countries' bold responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting fiscal challenges, and the lessons these offer for future crises including those resulting from climate change. The course will conclude with a forward-looking exercise, examining the role of integrated health, education, welfare and employment policies in better enabling developmental responses to both climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. This will include an exploration of the emerging work across the global South on a \u003cI\u003eJust Transition\u003c/I\u003e to green and sustainable development, which aims to optimally integrate climate, development and equity strategies.","enrolmentPreferences":"First-year students and sophomores intending to major in economics.","crossListing":["ECON 216"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021832","department":"ECON","number":218,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1774,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Capital And Coercion","titleShort":"Capital And Coercion","instructors":[{"id":1811,"name":"Ashok S.

Is it more economical to purchase art at auction or to work with dealers or (for contemporary works) directly with artists? Do museums consider value in the same way as private collectors? What role does an object's history and condition play in the evaluation process? In this course students will work as teams to identify and propose objects for addition to the collection of the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA). A significant budget will be made available for the acquisition. We will discuss approaches for identification, acquisition and evaluation of objects. Student teams will be responsible for identifying a set of objects that would make appropriate additions to the WCMA collection, and a strategy for acquiring one or more of those objects. Working with the advice of WCMA curatorial staff, one or more of these objects will be acquired using the agreed strategy, and the object will become part of the WCMA permanent collection.

How do income and health interact, and which causes the other? How is the level of economic inequality in the country perceived? Which historic policies have led to specific inequalities, and was the inequality an intentional or inadvertent outcome?

How does the financial system help with the management of risks faced by society? We will also study the role of the central bank (the Federal Reserve in the US), monetary policy, and government regulation and their impacts on financial decision making.

Topics include how individual responses to economic incentives can be influenced by heuristics, framing, social norms, and other psychological motives; we will also study how these concepts are incorporated into microeconomics models. Concurrently, the course will review applications of these ideas to public policy and firm strategy. For instance, we will examine how behavioral economics has informed efforts to reduce poverty, increase environmental conservation, encourage long-term financial planning, and improve health and diet outcomes, among many other topics. The course will also discuss whether and how we ought to judge which behaviors are socially desirable and worth encouraging through policy.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over-enrolled, I will aim to accept a mix of years and majors","crossListing":["ECON 233"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010857","department":"ECON","number":251,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1778,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Price And Allocation Theory","titleShort":"Price And Allocation Theory","instructors":[{"id":2771,"name":"Sarah A.

To finance their policies, governments must build the fiscal capacity to implement a tax system. In turn, fiscal capacity--the ability for the government to raise revenue--depends on economic development. This endogeneity between fiscal capacity and economic development creates challenges for tax policy in developing countries. Given these challenges, what types of taxes should countries use to raise revenues? How can governments build the fiscal capacity to generate revenue to finance critical services? This class explores tax policy from a global and comparative perspective. Because most students will be CDE fellows, we will emphasize tax policy issues, examples, and evidence that are pertinent to developing countries. However, many tax policy lessons are universal so we will also learn about tax policies in developed countries, especially issues relevant for transnational transactions. Topics addressed include: how economic principles can be applied to the efficiency and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the economy; ideas for fundamental tax reforms; the debate over progressive taxes versus \"flat\" taxes; how taxes affect incentives to save and invest; how market failures and administrative problems may influence the optimality of tax policy; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for tax policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on foreign direct investment, labor supply, and tax evasion; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; taxes on imports and exports; presumptive taxation; and the informal economy and its implications for tax policy.","enrolmentPreferences":"CDE students, but undergraduates with the prerequisites are welcome","crossListing":["ECON 389","ECON 514"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"016121","department":"ECON","number":394,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1979,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"European Economic History","titleShort":"European Economic History","instructors":[{"id":2600,"name":"Steven E.

We will build familiarity with discrete-time dynamic optimization techniques, develop and solve workhorse monetary DSGE (dynamic-stochastic general equilibrium) models, and explore the interactions between nominal variables (such as inflation and nominal interest rates) and real economic variables (such as output and unemployment) - over the business cycle and in the long-run. The second part of the course will extend the monetary macro models developed in the first part by incorporating foundations for credit, banking, and fintech to understand why the needs for these financial arrangements arise and how they interact with money and monetary policy.","enrolmentPreferences":"Junior or senior economics majors who are interested in monetary economics and macro-finance.","crossListing":["ECON 452"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"010838","department":"ECON","number":453,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3786,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Research And Methods In Applied Microeconomics","titleShort":"Research In Applied Micro","instructors":[{"id":10254,"name":"Owen Thompson"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"08:30","end":"09:45","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"A series of short papers and empirical exercises, constructive contributions to class discussion, class presentations, and a 15- to 20-page original empirical research paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"ECON 251 and ECON 255 or POEC 253","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"The main goal of this course is to expose students to modern empirical economic research.\nThe basic format for each class session will be to read and discuss in detail a single academic journal article.

Some risks are environmental--both manmade problems and natural disasters; other risks include the possibility of terrorist attack and, more locally, issues of campus safety. This tutorial explores both the private market responses to risk (e.g., financial markets, insurance markets, private contracting, and precautionary investments and saving) and government policies towards risk (e.g., regulation, taxation, and the legal system). From a theoretical standpoint, the course will build on expected utility theory, diversification, options valuation, principal-agent models, contract theory, and cost-benefit analysis. We will apply these tools to a wide variety of economic issues such as the ones listed above. One goal of the course is to discover common themes across the disparate topics.

While typical answers emphasize proximate causes like factor accumulation (i.e., growth in physical and human capital), technological progress, and demographic change, the institutional approach highlights the role of social, political, and cultural factors, broadly defined, as fundamental determinants of economic prosperity. The central idea is that the value-added of economic activities to society is primarily conditioned by the social arrangements within which these activities occur -- namely, arrangements that generate a structure of private incentives, which can either promote behavior that is conducive to economic development or lead to the pursuit of private gain at the expense of the common good. Thus, the key to economic development in this approach is the emergence of complementary institutions and structures of governance in society. This course will survey the recent literature on the topic of institutions and economic development, with an emphasis on empirical evidence in the context of both historical and contemporary societies. The purpose of the course will be to expose students to the core ideas and empirical tools employed at the frontier of research in this area. The readings will primarily comprise published journal articles and unpublished working papers, and students should expect to apply concepts from across all the core courses in economics.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior Economics majors","crossListing":["ECON 459"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017860","department":"ECON","number":463,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1807,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Financial History","titleShort":"Financial History","instructors":[{"id":2613,"name":"Gerard Caprio"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MW","start":"19:00","end":"20:15","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Either 6 short papers or 3 short papers and one longer research paper (student choice), at least two oral presentations, and contributions to class discussions.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 255 (or STAT 346 or Poli Ec 253) are required.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"What can we learn from financial history to understand the successes and failures of finance today and in coming years?

Do all economies face comparable challenges to achieving sustained economic growth? Will poorer countries ever catch up to richer ones? To answer these and other related questions, we will explore the underlying mechanisms of economic growth. What role is played by savings and investment (i.e., the accumulation of physical capital)? What is the influence of population growth? How important are investments in human capital (i.e., education and population health)? What about technological differences across nations? How much significance should we ascribe to cross-country differences in geographical characteristics? How much should we ascribe to differences in the quality of institutions? For each question, we will explore both theoretical and empirical approaches, ranging from formal models to qualitative historical evidence to cross-country growth regressions. We will debate the usefulness of these different approaches for development policy and will discuss the reasons why so many questions about economic growth remain difficult to answer.","enrolmentPreferences":"Junior and senior economics majors only; this is a core course in the master's program at the CDE, so undergraduate enrollment is very limited and requires instructor's permission","crossListing":["ECON 501"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"014062","department":"ECON","number":502,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1844,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Statistics/Econometrics","titleShort":"Statistics/Econometrics","instructors":[{"id":1823,"name":"Anand V.

We also consider ways that human behavior might deviate from perfect rationality, and what that might imply for policy. Along the way, we apply these concepts to various examples of policy issues, including, among other things, the environment, education, health, infrastructure, security, social insurance, and aid to the poor. We then turn to the general question of how to make the government work better, addressing questions such as the following. When is it better to have the government own and produce things, and when is it better to privatize? What are the incentives of politicians and government employees, and how does the design of political and budgetary institutions affect the degree to which they serve the public interest? How should responsibilities be divided up between the central government and local governments, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of \"decentralization?\" What can be done to improve the delivery of basic services?

Throughout the course, a variety of tools of modern economics will be considered, such as theory-based quantitative structural methods, reduced form empirics, and field experiments, and we will study the consequences of finance on economic well-being.\nThe first part of the course focuses on the functions of finance, how it contributes to growth and poverty alleviation, and what can be done to increase financial inclusion. What are the key parts of the infrastructure that are needed to improve access to financial services, including via 'fintech,' which is taking off in many developing countries? The second part of the course will build upon the first part and investigate how imperfections in financial development could make developing countries susceptible to short-term stability issues.

To finance their policies, governments must build the fiscal capacity to implement a tax system. In turn, fiscal capacity--the ability for the government to raise revenue--depends on economic development. This endogeneity between fiscal capacity and economic development creates challenges for tax policy in developing countries. Given these challenges, what types of taxes should countries use to raise revenues? How can governments build the fiscal capacity to generate revenue to finance critical services? This class explores tax policy from a global and comparative perspective. Because most students will be CDE fellows, we will emphasize tax policy issues, examples, and evidence that are pertinent to developing countries. However, many tax policy lessons are universal so we will also learn about tax policies in developed countries, especially issues relevant for transnational transactions. Topics addressed include: how economic principles can be applied to the efficiency and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the economy; ideas for fundamental tax reforms; the debate over progressive taxes versus \"flat\" taxes; how taxes affect incentives to save and invest; how market failures and administrative problems may influence the optimality of tax policy; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for tax policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on foreign direct investment, labor supply, and tax evasion; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; taxes on imports and exports; presumptive taxation; and the informal economy and its implications for tax policy.","enrolmentPreferences":"CDE students, but undergraduates with the prerequisites are welcome","crossListing":["ECON 389","ECON 514"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"010918","department":"ECON","number":515,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3829,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Developing Country Macroeconomics II: Institutions And Policy Regimes","titleShort":"Developing Country Macro II","instructors":[{"id":2724,"name":"Kenneth N.

His claims are echoed a century and a half later in Audre Lorde's \"Poetry is Not a Luxury,\"; in which she argues that poetry is a vital and essential part of her own political struggle as a Black lesbian feminist. But when W.B. Yeats--himself a very politically involved poet--writes in 1917 that \"from the quarrel with others comes rhetoric; from the quarrel with ourselves comes poetry,\" he implies that poetry would suffer from too much involvement with the \"quarrel with others\" that is politics. And when W. H. Auden writes in 1939 that \"poetry makes nothing happen\" he appears to locate poetry's value precisely in its irrelevance to politics as such. This course will focus on the vexed relationship between poetry and political struggle, reading predominantly poetry and poetics (writings about poetry) of the last two centuries in an effort to answer the questions: what can poetry do for politics? what does politics do for (or to) poetry? Is poetry essential to political struggle, or do poetry and politics mix only to the detriment of both, producing, on the one hand, bad poetry, and on the other, mere distractions from the \"real\" work of politics?

In order to track this political and poetic revolution, we will take an interdisciplinary approach that brings together historical, critical, and literary documents (including archival ones) and visual products (through the Object Lab of the Williams College Art Museum) that recreate the rich context of the period and help us consider the important social nature of aesthetic production. At the center of the course will be writings of major poets of the period, as well as anthologies and feminist periodicals that published their work and created a significant forum and shared space for women to articulate the politics and poetics of change. These periodicals and anthologies will also help us track the diversity of the feminist poetry movement and its intersection with issues of race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality. Ultimately, we will want to consider how poetry serves as an important tool for thinking through questions of power and injustice and what role it plays in creating necessary imaginative space in the world for expression, critique, and change.","enrolmentPreferences":"First years","crossListing":["AMST 113","ENGL 113","WGSS 113"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017185","department":"ENGL","number":114,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1816,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Literary Speakers","titleShort":"Literary Speakers","instructors":[{"id":2290,"name":"Stephen Fix"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MWF","start":"10:00","end":"10:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"4 or 5 papers, of varying lengths, spaced throughout the term (about 15-20 pages total); detailed feedback will be provided on each paper, along with opportunities for revision.

When Sir Thomas Wyatt introduced the sonnet to England in the 1500s with his translations of Petrarch, the form quickly became entrenched in English, and has been in regular use ever since. Originally penned as expressions of idealized love, sonnets soon expanded to address other kinds of emotionally intense relationships--to God, Nature, art, a particular place, the State, oppressors--while still, obsessively, returning to love in all its myriad forms. This makes the sonnet, deeply personal though it is, also a kind of pocket-sized literary tradition, as each new generation of poets extends, disrupts, and comments upon the whole history of sonnets. \"A sonnet is a moment's monument,\" wrote D.G. Rossetti (in, of course, a sonnet)--speaking of the sonnet's tendency to offer just a snapshot of the poet's mental and emotional state--but the tradition of producing numbered sequences of sonnets can also string those moments into a kind of narrative. Similarly, while the sonnet is founded in strong feeling, it is also obsessed with logic, delighting in logical argumentation, contradictions and paradoxes. This course will focus on a broad range of sonnets, historically, geographically and thematically, as well as criticism and theory relating to sonnets. Studying sonnets that are variously inspiring, devastating, and lol funny, we will become Sonnet Experts, while developing broadly useful skills in careful reading, concise writing and sound argumentation. Poets will include Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Keats, Elizabeth Barret Browning, DG and Christina Rossetti, Claude McKay, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Berryman, Seamus Heaney, Vikram Seth, and many, many more. No prior experience with poetry is presumed.","enrolmentPreferences":"First-year students","crossListing":["ENGL 131"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020778","department":"ENGL","number":138,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1982,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"What Is A Self?

The \"Tiger Mom\"--highly controlling, strict, severe almost to the point of abuse--has become the go-to phrase for many Americans when referring to traditional East Asian mothering styles. This attempt to categorize and simplify cultural differences fails to capture the complex nature of East Asian mothering. While the American public imagines East Asian parenting as only unwavering and harsh, immigrant parents, for example, must often find a parenting strategy that bridges traditional East Asian and mainstream American norms. This course will explore the ways that contemporary Asian American authors depict the complexity of East Asian mothering and mothers. What kinds of mothering does the reductive category of Tiger Mom ignore? What are the central questions these authors pose about mothers and motherhood? How do they negotiate the tension between the individual versus the community, or the pursuit of the child's own interests as opposed to success as defined by the parent when it comes to that child's future? And what are the pitfalls of reading literature as social science? In keeping with tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the instructor once a week; during these meetings, one student will present a short analytical paper on the texts covered that week. The other student will write a response paper and join the instructor in a discussion of both papers.

In this course, we will examine the material and technological history of hip hop culture, with particular attention to hip hop's tendency to sample, remix, mash-up, and repurpose existing media artifacts to create new works or art. We will use a media archaeological approach to examine the precise material conditions that first gave rise to graffiti art, deejaying, rapping, and breakdancing, and to analyze hip hop songs, videos, and films. Media archaeology is a critical and artistic practice that seeks to interpret the layers of significance embedded in cultural artifacts. How does hip hop archaeology remix the past, the present, and the future?

In their most familiar form, elegies honor and memorialize the dead. More broadly conceived, the genre includes works lamenting other kinds of loss as well: the loss of a lover, place, country, or cherished version of one's past. We'll consider the special challenges and opportunities of the elegiac voice: how it manages to give public expression to private grief; negotiates problems of tone and perspective; worries about and celebrates the capacity of language to generate hope and consolation; and seeks a kind of solace in the literary effort to evoke, preserve, or rewrite a lost life or an absent past. This course focuses primarily on poetry, English and American, across a broad historical range. We'll first read poems from 1600-1900--including works by Jonson, Milton, Donne, Dryden, Gray, Shelley, Tennyson, and Whitman, and then turn to some of the twentieth-century's great poetic elegists--Wilfred Owen, W.B.Yeats, W.H.Auden, Robert Lowell, and Seamus Heaney. Finally, we'll consider how the elegiac voice works in fiction, especially in stories by James Joyce (\"The Dead\") and Vladimir Nabokov (\"Spring in Fialta\").","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomores, but juniors and seniors are also welcome.","crossListing":["ENGL 227"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010219","department":"ENGL","number":231,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1397,"consent":"I","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Literature Of The Sea","titleShort":"Literature Of The Sea","instructors":[{"id":12008,"name":"Ned G.

Such is the challenge of \"understanding\" the traditions of the absurd. In this tutorial course, we will engage this challenge within the realm of Western theatre and performance from 1900 to the present. Beginning with selected readings from writers who have engaged the absurd in theoretical fashion (Albert Camus, Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Esslin), the course will move swiftly to original artworks for contemplation and analysis. Some questions we will grapple with include: How do we, can we, should we respond to art that specifically defies meaning? Can art that seems pointless have a point? Playwrights will range from canonical (Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco) to more obscure but equally engaging (as well as baffling) artists (Peter Handke, Slavomir Mrocek).

From Jane Austen's \"3 or 4 families in a country village\" to the teeming novels of Charles Dickens, the novel's distinctive power is in making both the few and the many feel like a complete world. But what are worlds, anyway? Are they spaces? Or are they not a thing at all, but social systems--ways of belonging that are constantly being made and remade? This course is about the specific world--imagining powers of the novel, tracing out various techniques and strategies by which literary texts create worlds. Our hunch: the modern notion of \"world\" finds its origin in the novel, and the novel constitutes one of the most sophisticated sites of reflection upon that notion. We'll read a number of novels, ranging from 19th-century authors like Austen and Dickens, to contemporary genre writing--science fiction and the detective novel--to see how novels, and ideas of world, shift over time and space. To get at our central questions, we'll read some philosophical and critical texts preoccupied by world-ness, consider the colonial contexts of some novel worlds, and engage contemporary debates around the possibilities of \"World Literature.\" Likely authors include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, Italo Calvino, and China Mieville.","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomores and first-year students","crossListing":["COMP 268","ENGL 263"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"010980","department":"ENGL","number":281,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3777,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Introductory Workshop In Poetry","titleShort":"Introductory Poetry Workshop","instructors":[{"id":8393,"name":"Jessica M.

We will ask common and important questions, such as \"Can one have too many friends?\"; \"Are long-distance friendships sustainable?\"; and \"What health risks do we take for friendship, and what other risks do technologies of friendship carry?\" Readings will include works of fiction and journalism, and scholarship from psychology, the history of technology, and science and technology studies.

On the one hand, we will think about work: What does it mean to have an occupation today? There was a time when most people could distinguish between the time of work and that of leisure. But we live under a different regime. What now is the difference between work and leisure for those working \"gigs\"? In the case of \"creatives,\" Bifo Berardi says, it is the soul itself that has been put to work. And then there are those who are unemployed, i.e., those occupied by the most widespread form of work there is--looking for work. On the other hand, we will ask questions about colonialism: Did not Europe's occupation of the globe birth this world in which the only way to live is to be occupied in a narrow sense, i.e., to always be working or looking for work? And isn't one economic function of the occupation of peoples in our own times to create a cheap workforce?

In what ways did religious devotion, erotic passion, and dream inform political thinking and shape the public sphere? We'll consider the relationship between intimate feeling, apocalyptic desire, and the material realities of a burgeoning British empire--enclosure, dispossession, transatlantic enslavement. As prophetic modes overlap with and inflect controversies such as the querelle des femmes, the witch hunt, and the execution of Charles I, we'll interrogate the construction and deconstruction of social identities. Thus a collateral concern will be recent critical approaches to the early modern category of \"woman\"--in Black feminism, queer studies, and Marxist-feminism. Throughout our inquiry, we'll take seriously the claim that the seventeenth century was \"radical\"--in the sense of enacting a \"departure from what is usual or traditional\" and in the sense of being the \"root, basis, or foundation\" of a modernity we are still living in and through (see Oxford English Dictionary, \"radical\" def. 7c and def. 2).","enrolmentPreferences":"English Majors","crossListing":["ENGL 304"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022313","department":"ENGL","number":305,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3783,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"The American Modernist Novel","titleShort":"The American Modernist Novel","instructors":[{"id":2356,"name":"John K.

It's hard to shake the feeling that Milton is the fustiest of English poets--dull, pious, brilliant and all, and not someone you would read if you didn't have to. But then what are we to make of the following? The first piece that Milton wrote that was read widely throughout Europe was a boisterous defense of the English Revolution. Milton was most famous in his lifetime as the poet who went to bat for the Puritan insurgents--the poet who came right out and said that the king looked better without his head. Of all the major English poets, Milton is the revolutionary. So a course on Milton is by necessity a course on literature and revolution. We will read Paradise Lost, widely regarded as the greatest non-dramatic poem in English, and a few other books to help us prepare for that big one. Some questions: How did the mid-seventeenth century, probably the most tumultuous decades in the history of modern Britain, transform the culture of the English-speaking world? What is the relationship between literature and the state or between literature and radical politics? Is there a poetics of revolution? How can a poet who seems to be writing for Sunday school--about God and Adam and Eve and the serpent--really have been writing about rebellion all along?","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors","crossListing":["ENGL 315","REL 319"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022385","department":"ENGL","number":316,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1560,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Unfinishing America","titleShort":"Unfinishing America","instructors":[{"id":0,"name":"William H.

Few would argue that any one work of fiction could capture the essence of American life. In this class, we will flip the Great American Novel on its head by reading Ralph Ellison's unfinished second novel. After publishing the acclaimed Invisible Man in 1952, Ellison seemed poised to deliver the next Great American Novel. But he never did. When he died in 1994, 42 years later, he left behind thousands of pages of material, but no finished second novel. Why wasn't he able to finish it? Some of it was bad luck. Some of it was a struggle with genre and form. However, perhaps the real reason Ellison's novel proved impossible is what it was trying to say. This is a book about the historical trauma of racism. Therefore, the thesis of this class is that the Great American Novel cannot be written as long as American history remains whitewashed. Ellison's manuscript shows this in surprising ways, from its depiction of racial passing and the taboo of interracial sex to its extended exploration of Black and Indigenous cultures in the former Oklahoma Territory. In addition to Ellison, we will read the work of the Chicano author Tomás Rivera, whose fragmentary fictions provoke similar questions. This class culminates in a final project that asks students to \"unfinish\" an American cultural object.","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors","crossListing":["AMST 326","ENGL 316"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019266","department":"ENGL","number":317,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1603,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Black Migrations: African American Performance At Home And Abroad","titleShort":"African American Performance","instructors":[{"id":2863,"name":"Rashida K.

Instead of searching for an answer at the movement's supposed point of origin (1790-1830, in Germany, England, and France), we will begin in early twentieth-century South Asia. In the nineteenth century, English Romantic poetry and, to a lesser extent, ethico-political and aesthetic ideas associated with German Idealism circulated in South Asia as part of a colonial education aimed at producing \"a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect\" (Macaulay). The intentions of this plan of education aside, it unwittingly opened channels for literary, philosophical, and political exchange that were harmful to colonial rule, and essential to how we understand worlds of literature today. Behind the backs of its homegrown, self-anointed inheritors, Romanticism in the \"colonies\" led multiple other lives and was transformed in encounters that must--belatedly--be read back into its originary texts. Hence, in counter-chronological fashion, in this class we will begin with important postcolonial works by Faiz Ahmad Faiz (Urdu), Suryakant Tripathi Nirala (Hindi), Mahadevi Verma (Hindi), Sarojini Naidu (English), Mohammad Iqbal (Urdu and Persian), and Rabindranath Tagore (Bengali), to move on to Karl Marx and Heinrichs Heine (German), Charles Baudelaire (French), and George Eliot (English), to end with John Keats (English), William Wordsworth (English), and G.W.F. Hegel (German). In considering these texts with an eye to poetics and interpretation, we will pay close attention to concepts that they bring to the fore, key among them \"belatedness\" (Nachträglichkeit), \"allegory\", \"critique,\" \"non-identity.\" We will read non-English language texts in translation, though we will have occasion to discuss originals.","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors, then sophomores considering the major","crossListing":["COMP 327","ENGL 324"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022075","department":"ENGL","number":327,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1837,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Autofiction","titleShort":"Autofiction","instructors":[{"id":2356,"name":"John K.

When riots, censorship, trials, and vilification greet such works in moments of political and social upheaval, the public outrage is often strangely out of proportion to either the work's aesthetic nature or its overt commentary on the political crisis. Something powerfully symptomatic is at work, then: a set of threatened investments, unacknowledged values, and repressed ideas which surface explosively, but indirectly, in the aesthetic outrage. In an attempt to understand the strange logic of public outrage against works of art, we will explore the respective works' historical contexts, and use theoretical models--aesthetic, political, psychological, social--as a means of illuminating the dynamics of outrage and exposing understated linkages between a work's figurative logic and the political passions of its historical moment. We will study instances of outrage in the context of the French Revolution (Beaumarchais' \u003cI\u003eThe Marriage of Figaro\u003c/I\u003e), the wave of anarchist terrorism in turn-of-the-century Paris (Jarry's \u003cI\u003eUbu the King\u003c/I\u003e), the trials of Oscar Wilde for \"gross indecency\" (\u003cI\u003eThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u003c/I\u003e), the Irish Revolution (Synge's \u003cI\u003eThe Playboy of the Western World\u003c/I\u003e and O'Casey's \u003cI\u003eThe Plough and the Stars\u003c/I\u003e), and Stalinist collectivization (Eisenstein's suppressed film \u003cI\u003eBezhin Meadow\u003c/I\u003e).

Shaking off its early disrepute, and taking advantage of growing literacy and innovations in production and distribution, it achieved in this period an unrivalled synthesis of mass appeal and aesthetic and social ambition. Its representational aspirations were breathtaking: attempting to comprehend in its pages the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as to delineate in finest detail the texture of individual lives and minds. In an age obsessed with the social, it engaged directly with the most compelling issues of the day, including industrialization and the gap between rich and poor, the role of women, nationalism and imperialism, and more broadly, the very nature of historical change itself. But it did so, for the most part, by telling fine-grained stories of ordinary men and women, people trying to make a living, worrying about their families and their neighbors, facing illness and death, and falling in--and sometimes out of--love. Since so many of these stories remain highly accessible works of popular culture, we will work hard to focus on what is strange and specific about the fiction of the nineteenth century, while also recognizing the roots of much that is modern in our own culture. We will also take seriously their social ambitions, looking especially at the ways they formulate, promote, and contest their readers' understanding of themselves as subjects and agents of an ongoing social history.

We will also examine how each poet engages questions of gender and sexuality, as well as contemporary debates surrounding such issues as abolition, slavery, women's suffrage, temperance, and settler colonialism. We will consider what role their whiteness plays in their poetry and personas.

In this course, we will take up the theme of separation as a privileged point of entry into postcolonial literature and towards understanding the multiple meanings of \"postcoloniality.\" We will encounter examples in which this theme shapes critical thought and helps imagine new modes of existence, as well as those in which the grief of separation shades into such overpowering melancholy that writing becomes impossible. We will also look at what the preoccupation with separation can tell us about the ways human beings relate to human and non-human objects, and how they make and experience history. To think through these issues, we will read nineteenth and twentieth century works dealing with experiences of love, ecstasy, migrancy, exile, and slavery, composed in diverse geographical, socio-political, and linguistic contexts. We will read works (novels, poems, memoirs, essays) and watch films from South Asia, Egypt, the Caribbeans, the US, and Europe, composed in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, French, Arabic, Bengali and Malyalam).","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors, then sophomores considering the major","crossListing":["COMP 350","ENGL 352","ASIA 353"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020786","department":"ENGL","number":355,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3805,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Motherhood And Horror: The Movie","titleShort":"Motherhood And Horror","instructors":[{"id":2467,"name":"James R.

Their formal experiments were driven in striking ways by their response to recent dissident trends in attitudes toward sexuality, gender, and marriage, and their consequent engagement with so-called \"irregular unions,\" sexual relationships forged out of wedlock in the face of societal repression and in the name of more liberated ideas of sexual morality. For James and Ford, such revolutions in the social sphere prompted renewed scrutiny of conceptions of moral fidelity and integrity, new ways of capturing subjectivity and its limitations, and a radical probing of what it means to know. Their work reflects the transition from the norms of Victorianism to a disorienting modern world marked by newly permissive social behavior, class mobility and conflict, emergent technological and commercial forms, suffragism and \"the New Woman,\" and world war.

The first-person narrative chronicling the life of a fictional figure bearing a close relationship to Proust himself spans several decades from the late 19th to the early 20th century, centering on French high society as it enters the modern world, shaped by historical events such as the Dreyfus Affair and the First World War. Proust's exploration of the consciousness of the protagonist, an aspiring writer, has led readers to see him as a philosopher of aesthetics, of the psyche, of time and memory, and of the nature of desire. His narrative ranges from meditations on such subjects to social satire to absorbing and sometimes soap opera-like plots exploring upward and downward social mobility and a wide array of sexual entanglements, straight and queer. Through his fluent prose, Proust renders the vicissitudes of desire, loss, and joy, of betrayal and emotional intransigence, and tests the power of memory and the imagination to recapture the past. Because of the length of \u003cI\u003eIn Search of Lost Time\u003c/I\u003e, the emphasis of the course will be more on reading (about 7 to 7½ hours per week) and less on writing (four or five 1½-page journal entries and a final paper of 8-10 pages) than the average 300-level course; and approximately one-third of the sequence will be bracketed as optional reading.","enrolmentPreferences":"English, French, and Comparative Literature majors","crossListing":["COMP 378","ENGL 378","RLFR 378"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011085","department":"ENGL","number":382,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1850,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Advanced Workshop In Poetry","titleShort":"Advanced Workshop In Poetry","instructors":[{"id":8393,"name":"Jessica M.

How does the study of such literary labors change or inflect the way we describe generic forms (tragedy, comedy, lyric) and the way we read otherwise central gestures of Shakespearean plots: clasping, lending, building, mending, praying, stealing, murdering, mothering.\nEach of Shakespeare's plays will anchor a set of other readings in Shakespeare's sources and contemporaries (e.g. Burton, Montaigne, Hayklut, Petrarch, Marlowe, More) and in theories of work, labor, and the body (e.g. Ahmed, Arendt, Bourdieu, Butler, Fanon, Foucault, Marx, Ngai).","enrolmentPreferences":"English Majors","crossListing":["ENGL 395"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"011103","department":"ENGL","number":397,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3810,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: English","titleShort":"Independent Study: English","instructors":[{"id":2602,"name":"Gage C.

Shelley, Dickens, Eliot, Ford, Woolf, Morrison, Sebald, and Roy. Exploring the uses of gothic and sensational effects, dystopian and utopian possibilities, and fractured time, we will consider the aesthetic and political experiments historical novels have spawned. We will do so in context of the sustained critical engagement with the genre by such thinkers as Lukacs, Benjamin, Adorno, Jameson, McKeon and Moretti.","enrolmentPreferences":"English majors","crossListing":["COMP 406","ENGL 402"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021841","department":"ENGL","number":418,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3813,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Modernisms And The Archive","titleShort":"Modernisms And The Archive","instructors":[{"id":10241,"name":"Bethany Hicok"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TF","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Short papers, archival presentations, final paper or digital project (12-15 pages)","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"A 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This seminar positions us at the intersection of archival theory, print culture, and literary study in order to chart new pathways for understanding the making of modern poetry and poetics during the period of literary history (from 1900 to 1945) that we most closely associate with the term Modernism. Modernist Studies is at the moment undergoing a major and exciting shift made possible by digital archives that allow us to access and document the rich intertextual experience of reading Modernism as it unfolded in the influential little magazines that came to define Modernisms. Some, like Poetry magazine, defined the new poetry strictly along aesthetic lines and treated these publications as collectible objects. Others, such as The Crisis, brought together poetry and the politics of race and social justice and encouraged, as Bartholomew Brinkman has argued, \"both aesthetic and socially engaged readings.\" We take advantage of digital archives, as well as physical ones, in order to tell new stories about both familiar and unfamiliar writers that can be discovered at the intersections of literary history and archives. Students will also have the opportunity to work in the Sterling Brown archive here at Williams. Recently acquired by Williams College Library Special Collections, this significant archive documents the life, work, and poetic practice of African-American writer and educator Sterling Brown, whose poetry and prose spans nearly five decades of the twentieth century, yet Brown has often been left out of the narrative we tell about modern poetry. Work in the Sterling Brown archive will culminate in a curated public exhibition featuring your discoveries. Iain Bailey has argued that we should think of the archive \"as a place of work, rather than as a cache from which to draw certainties.\" With this caveat in mind and in the spirit of discovery, we will act over the course of the semester as investigators, curators, collaborators, and inquirers in the workshop of literary production and its aesthetic products.","enrolmentPreferences":"English Majors, American Studies Majors","crossListing":["AMST 418","ENGL 418"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"018158","department":"ENGL","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1856,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Honors Colloquium: English","titleShort":"Honors Colloquium: English","instructors":[{"id":2602,"name":"Gage C.

These changes are not necessarily natural, uniform or linear across space and time. As colonial conquests sought to capture, dominate and exploit vast swathes of land, nature and people, supported by economic theories, violent, wide-ranging and long-term changes profoundly altered the environment and human-nature relationships. This course examines these transformations, specifically attending to the relationship between colonized/colonial (hu)man, nature and non-human species, drawing in perceptions of nature and the economy. Our starting point for this intellectual journey is the colonial imprint on human-ecological relations i.e. economic man, or Sylvia Wynter's conception of \"ethno-class man\" and \"homo-economicus\". We will consider social difference especially race as a central conjuncture of the changing relationship of capitalism and social organization relative to natural resource extraction, techno-scientific knowledge, industrial development and resulting accumulation of greenhouse gases that induce climate and ecological crises. We will also examine economic perspectives of climate change as a market failure, loss of economic value or a financial risk to stock portfolios that may be at odds with humane ways of organizing our collective planet. This course exposes the hierarchies of social difference and resulting inequalities (class, race, gender, species) under climate crisis to advance reparative and decolonial understandings. Drawing upon experiences from social, labor and environmental movements for climate justice, students will be able evaluate situated political economic responses to the climate crisis.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over enrolled preference goes to Africana Studies and then Environmental Studies students.","crossListing":["ENVI 204","GBST 233","AFR 233"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020980","department":"ENVI","number":208,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1173,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Saharan Imaginations","titleShort":"Saharan Imaginations","instructors":[{"id":10244,"name":"Brahim El Guabli"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active participation, short presentation, short weekly responses on GLOW, midterm exam, and final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Deconstructing reductive Saharanism, which the course conceptualizes as a universalizing discourse about deserts, this course seeks to critically examine the myriad assumptions that are projected upon deserts across times and cultures.

Students will use a media they master to investigate a theme connecting design, the built environment (architecture and urbanism), and spatial justice.","enrolmentPreferences":"Studio Art majors, Art History and Studio Art majors, Envi majors and concentrators","crossListing":["ARTS 314","ENVI 310"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022191","department":"ENVI","number":316,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1289,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Governing Cities By Design: The Built Environment As A Technology Of Space","titleShort":"Governing Cities By Design","instructors":[{"id":13537,"name":"Giuseppina Forte"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"08:30","end":"09:45","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"Because This Seminar Is Cross-Listed With ARTS, There Is A Studio Component (Short Assignments And Final Project)","classReqEval":"Active presence in class discussions and presentations, willingness to experiment, contributions to a collaborative seminar/studio environment, quality of work, depth and quality of the investigative process.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"ENVI 101 or instructor permission","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Like in the classic era, cities of the 19th century were metaphors for government: good government could not exist without good governance of the city.

It was on the banks of this river that the great Egyptian empires were founded that led to the building of some of humanity's most astounding structures and artworks. While the Nile seems eternal and almost beyond time and place, now in the 21st century, the Nile River is at a historical turning point. The water level and quality is dwindling while at the same time the number of people who rely on the river is ever increasing. This alarming nexus of demography, climate change, and economic development has led to increasingly urgent questions of the Nile´s future. Is the Nile dying? How has the river, and people´s relationship with it, changed over the last century? This course will consider the history of the Nile and and its built and natural environment. After a brief overview of the role of the river in ancient Egypt, we will explore the modern political and cultural history of the Nile. By following an imaginary droplet flowing from tributaries until it makes its way into the Mediterranean Sea, we will learn about the diverse peoples and cultures along the way. We will evaluate the numerous attempts to manage and control the Nile, including the building of big dams, and the continuous efforts to utilize the river for economic development such as agriculture and the tourism industry. At the end of the semester we will consider the relationship of the major urban centers with the Nile and whether the tensions among Nile riparian states will lead to \"water wars\" in East Africa and the Middle East.","enrolmentPreferences":"History and Arabic Studies majors","crossListing":["ARAB 308","ENVI 335","GBST 320","HIST 308","AFR 350"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020813","department":"ENVI","number":339,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1049,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Conservation Biology","titleShort":"Conservation Biology","instructors":[{"id":2192,"name":"Joan Edwards"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MWF","start":"09:00","end":"09:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":false,"div3":true,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"Lectures, Discussions, And A Weekly Lab.","classReqEval":"Evaluation will be based on lab assignments and reports, discussion participation, two exams and an independent project.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"BIOL 203/ENVI 203 or BIOL 220 or BIOL 305 or permission of instructor.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Conservation Biology focuses on protection of the Earth's biodiversity.

How did the modern standard form of each develop and what is its relationship to any non-standard languages or dialects? How do these three languages reflect sociolinguistic phenomena such as gender, class, and politeness? How do the writing systems of these languages function and what is the role of Chinese characters in them? What has been the influence of Classical Chinese on Modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean?

Through reading and analyzing ethnography, theory, and literature, it focuses on Indigenous peoples in a comparative context. Rather than prioritizing concern with Indigenous peoples emerging from the US, it attempts to demonstrate what Indigeneity has been in both the United States and Russia and what it is and means today. It asks the following questions: what is Indigeneity and who is Indigenous; how is Indigenous identity constructed and by whom; and what convergences and divergences exist in Indigeneity between the US and Russia or for that matter in other contexts? To help answer these questions, in this course we will grapples with Indigeneity as a social category and other social formations, especially ethnicity, nationality, and race. Topics include: Indigeneity and the State, Revitalization and Resurgence, Indigenous People and Nature Protection, and Hemispheric and Global Indigeneities.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and certificate-seekers in Russian, then majors in Anthropology and Sociology, and then Global Studies concentrators","crossListing":["ANTH 217","GBST 219","RUSS 217"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"019274","department":"GBST","number":221,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3854,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"South Asia: Colonialism To Independence, 1750-1947 CE","titleShort":"South Asia: 1750-1947 CE","instructors":[{"id":3039,"name":"Aparna Kapadia"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"This Class Will Also Have A Small But Significant Discussion Component.","classReqEval":"Class participation, response papers (2-3 pages), two short essays (4-5 pages), midterm and final exams","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None; open to all","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course focuses on the history of South Asia with the aim of providing an overview of the political and social landscape of the region from c. 1750 to 1947.

These changes are not necessarily natural, uniform or linear across space and time. As colonial conquests sought to capture, dominate and exploit vast swathes of land, nature and people, supported by economic theories, violent, wide-ranging and long-term changes profoundly altered the environment and human-nature relationships. This course examines these transformations, specifically attending to the relationship between colonized/colonial (hu)man, nature and non-human species, drawing in perceptions of nature and the economy. Our starting point for this intellectual journey is the colonial imprint on human-ecological relations i.e. economic man, or Sylvia Wynter's conception of \"ethno-class man\" and \"homo-economicus\". We will consider social difference especially race as a central conjuncture of the changing relationship of capitalism and social organization relative to natural resource extraction, techno-scientific knowledge, industrial development and resulting accumulation of greenhouse gases that induce climate and ecological crises. We will also examine economic perspectives of climate change as a market failure, loss of economic value or a financial risk to stock portfolios that may be at odds with humane ways of organizing our collective planet. This course exposes the hierarchies of social difference and resulting inequalities (class, race, gender, species) under climate crisis to advance reparative and decolonial understandings. Drawing upon experiences from social, labor and environmental movements for climate justice, students will be able evaluate situated political economic responses to the climate crisis.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over enrolled preference goes to Africana Studies and then Environmental Studies students.","crossListing":["AFR 233","ENVI 204","GBST 233"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022383","department":"GBST","number":279,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3721,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Islam On The Indian Ocean","titleShort":"Islam On The Indian Ocean","instructors":[{"id":5583,"name":"Saadia Yacoob"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Weekly responses, midterm essay, final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"While colonial and Eurocentric geographies speak in terms of continental separation, historically the continents of Africa and Asia have been connected to one another through a dual link: Islam and the Indian Ocean.

Commanding unprecedented resources and administering a population of 100 to 150 million at its zenith--much larger than any European empire in the early modern world--the Mughals established a centralized administration, with a vast complex of personnel, money, and information networks. Mughal emperors were also political and cultural innovators of global repute. Moreover, while the Mughal dynasty was brought to an end with British colonial rule over India in 1857, the Mughal administrative structures and cultural influences continued to have a lasting impact on the British and later Indian states that followed. Centered around the intersection of the themes of power, patronage of art and architecture and religion, this course will ask: What factors contributed to the durability of the Mughal Empire for three centuries? How did global trade and innovations in taxation contribute to its wealth and stability? How did this dynasty of Muslim monarchs rule over diverse, and largely non-Muslim populations? How did they combine Persian cultural elements with regional ones to establish an empire that was truly Indian in nature? How were the Mughals viewed in their contemporary world of gunpowder empires like the Safavids of Persia and the Ottomans of Turkey? Readings will include the best of the recent scholarship on this vastly influential empire and a rich collection of primary sources, including emperor's memoirs, accounts of European travelers, and racy biographies, which will allow students make their own analysis. They will also have the opportunity to interpret paintings (some of which are held in the WCMA collections) and architecture.

Building on this framework, this course foregrounds transepistemology as an equally important method for understanding the dynamics of America, both locally and globally, at the level of the world-system. In addition to tracing the consubstantial genealogy of racism and capitalism, we will examine their local manifestations, mainly in Asia, Europe, Africa and America, as well as their current geopolitical, social and economic outcomes, especially the reproduction of systemic inequalities and domination. Through an interdisciplinary approach and engagement with a variety of resources from economics, anthropology, sociology, critical race theory, comparative ethnic studies and decolonial thinking, this course will address the following: i) review the different forms of economic organization of human societies throughout history (with special focus on the work of Karl Polanyi); ii) trace the epistemological origins of capitalism and investigate what makes capitalism and its crises unique; iii) trace the genealogy of the concepts of race, racism and discrimination; iv) interrogate the intersection of racism and capitalism in different traditions of thought and epistemologies in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. For example, we will read key texts from \"French theory\", (Deleuze, Foucault, etc.), US Black tradition, (W. E. B. Du Bois and Cedric Robison, etc.), Chinese social sciences (Li Shenming, Cheng Enfu, etc.) and African economy and anthropology (Mahdi Elmandjra, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.) and Latin American decolonial philosophy (Quijano, Dussel, Mignolo, etc.) By doing this, we will situate the rupture that capitalism and racism introduced at the level of global history, which is the first step to conceptualizing racism and capitalism. After showing that the development of capitalism and racism are historically linked, we will proceed to examine the manifestations of their interaction at local and global levels. Locally, we will focus on the effects of racism on the labor market: discrimination in hiring, wage discrimination, segregation, duality and stratification of the labor market, etc. We will also analyze how sexism and racism play out in the labor market in racialized communities. We will also reflect on the links between racism and politics and their effects on economic policies. From a more global perspective, we will analyze the roots of the global economic crisis and the resulting geopolitical issues at the international level and the racist dynamics they generate. Overall, as we will move through readings, we will situate the United States in a cross-regional perspective that would enable us to develop critical insights concerning links and convergences between capitalism and racism.","enrolmentPreferences":"American Studies majors and seniors","crossListing":["AFR 353","AMST 345","GBST 344"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022303","department":"GBST","number":346,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3592,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Dark Debts: Race, Money And Finance In The Modern World Economy","titleShort":"Race, Money \u0026 Finance","instructors":[{"id":12787,"name":"Keston K.

Du Bois' 'The Souls of Black Folk', we explore how the modern construction of finance has evolved across various periods from chattel slavery, to Jim Crow, colonialism, the post-war era, decolonization, neoliberal financialization to the present. We will also engage contemporary topics like global financial crises, financialization, development finance, reparations, housing, 'green' finance in the context of climate change, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for Black and racialized communities.

Putting aside for a moment the very reasonable doubts about how justified this perception actually was, it is still worth asking, how did people who lived in the world in which differences in rank, class, gender or ethnicity were not supposed to matter, make sense of their postsocialist condition, one in which new forms of difference emerged, and old ones assumed greater prominence? And how do these encounters with difference impact current events, such as the war Russia is currently waging on Ukraine, or the persistent tensions between East and West Germans? This tutorial will examine new dilemmas through ethnographic studies and documentary films that aim to capture in real time the process of articulating and grappling with newly discovered divides. We will focus especially closely on Russia, but will also read studies on East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, and Ukraine. This course fulfills the DPE requirement by exploring comparatively the ways in which people in different countries made sense of the social, cultural and political heterogeneity of the postsocialist condition.","enrolmentPreferences":"Anthropology, Sociology, and Russian majors","crossListing":["GBST 348","RUSS 348","SOC 348"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017240","department":"GBST","number":397,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1728,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: International Studies","titleShort":"IndStdy:International Studies","instructors":[{"id":2250,"name":"Magnús T.

The aim is to have energised interdisciplinary discussions about topics of pressing societal relevance, to understand some of the fundamentals of ocean science, to develop expertise in gathering and distilling information by researching new topics, and thereby to improve critical and analytical thinking.","enrolmentPreferences":"First year and second year students","crossListing":["ENVI 109","GEOS 110","MAST 110"],"components":["Lecture","Laboratory"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011228","department":"GEOS","number":201,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1427,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Field Methods And Structural Geology","titleShort":"Structural Geology","instructors":[{"id":2459,"name":"Paul M.

Climate plays a central role in this feedback loop; the rise of mountains can change climate, and such changes can alter regional erosion rates. This course will examine how geologists use characteristic markers to estimate the amount of surface uplift, methods for determining uplift rate, surface response to faulting and folding, measuring displacement of the crust with GPS and interferometry methods, how mountain building affects erosion and exhumation rates, the limits to relief in mountains, and the interaction between mountains and climate.

Understanding sediments is also fundamental to society, for many kinds of civil engineering as well as pollution and environmental remediation.

Our materials include literature, magazine publications, paintings, monuments and popular culture in the Empire. Some specific themes we will address include the aims of the agents and \"architects\" of nationalism and the roles of religion and geography in nationalism and of national heroes and legends, and the definition of national identity in opposition to a perceived Other (France and Africans). The course will proceed thematically, focusing on the relationship between nationalism and public figures, nationalism and the Other, as well as nationalism and visual culture.

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and Austria, profound interiority surfaced frequently to challenge--and even threaten--what was touted as the triumph of objective, scientific thought, often leading to alienation and despair for the writers and thinkers who explored the deepest recesses of the mind. This course will explore and complicate the relationship between reason and those forces that throw it into question, focusing on particular moments when the tectonic plates of reason and supposed unreason converge and collide most forcefully: around 1800 (Kant, Goethe, Kleist, Büchner, Hoffmann), around 1900 (Freud, Kafka, Schnitzler), and the mid-twentieth century, when both forces combine to create the disaster of the \"Third Reich\" and the challenges of its aftermath (Hitler, Harlan, Bachmann, Szabo, Haneke).

Now almost forgotten, dusty reminders of Britain's imperial past, they were crucial moments in the \"Great Game\", the rivalry between the British and Russian empires for supremacy in Central Asia and control of land routes to British India. Largely disastrous for the British, the First Afghan War (1839-1842) resulted in the tragic deaths of some 16,000 individuals, the Second (1878-1881) generated considerable domestic discord, and the Third (1919) basically ended British influence in Afghan affairs. Nevertheless, they exercised the Victorian imagination and led to numerous cultural productions that will be dissected in our class: illustrated tales of British military exploits proliferated in the press; the children's writer G.A. Henty turned the conflicts into the stuff of imperial adventure; Rudyard Kipling made the Great Game the backdrop for several works of fiction; military officers, government officials, \"lady travelers\", and amateur scholars all mapped the landscape and people of Afghanistan, an endless source of fascination for the Victorians. By interpreting these various forms of documentary evidence, we will not only reconstruct the history of the wars Britain fought in Afghanistan, and the reasons for them, but dissect the stories Britons told themselves about their Empire and about Afghanistan and its people.","enrolmentPreferences":"First-year students, and then sophomores who have not taken a 100-level seminar or tutorial in History.","crossListing":["HIST 137"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"019216","department":"HIST","number":143,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3847,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Soccer And History In Latin America: Making The Beautiful Game","titleShort":"Soccer \u0026 History Latin America","instructors":[{"id":2194,"name":"Roger A.

Students will become familiar with several significant shifts in interpretation of key aspects of Japanese history, such as the growing appreciation of the roles of non-elites in history, and the shift away from the \"national seclusion\" understanding of Japanese foreign relations.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors, Asian Studies concentration students, then everyone else","crossListing":["HIST 217","ASIA 217"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"019274","department":"HIST","number":221,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3852,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"South Asia: Colonialism To Independence, 1750-1947 CE","titleShort":"South Asia: 1750-1947 CE","instructors":[{"id":3039,"name":"Aparna Kapadia"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"This Class Will Also Have A Small But Significant Discussion Component.","classReqEval":"Class participation, response papers (2-3 pages), two short essays (4-5 pages), midterm and final exams","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None; open to all","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course focuses on the history of South Asia with the aim of providing an overview of the political and social landscape of the region from c. 1750 to 1947.

Starting with the diversity of Indigenous societies that have inhabited and cared for lands and waters since \"time out of mind,\" it foregrounds the complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews situated in particular homelands, as well as accounts of origins and migrations. It addresses how societies confronted devastating epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial processes of colonization, extraction, and enslavement. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and homelands through pervasive violence, attempted genocide, and dispossession are addressed, as well as forms of relations and kinship with African-American and Afro-Indigenous people. It concludes with how different communities negotiated the tumultuous eras of the American Revolution, forced removal in the 1830s, and Civil War, and created pathways for endurance, self-determination, and security in its aftermath. The course centers on Indigenous actors--intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and many others--and consistently connects historical events with present-day matters of land, historical memory, education, caretaking, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum.

By the 1970s, however, the once dominant historical field of diplomatic history was beset by a sense of crisis; its practitioners consumed with anxiety over their marginalization in a discipline that embraced social and cultural theories that that seemed to render the narrow study of Western white men in power increasingly obsolete. For the past half-century, historians of American foreign relations have engaged in a sustained and ever-shifting debate, not only about the nature of American power, but over what can and should be included within the field's parameters. Today, annual meetings of the Society for American Foreign Relation--and its marquee journal, \u003cI\u003eDiplomatic History--\u003c/I\u003efeature scholarship ranging from \"traditional\" approaches to those centered on gender, sexuality, race, cultural exchange, emotion, environmental studies, sports, music, and more. Yet, debates still rage about whether this broadening has enriched the study of American power, or diluted it to the point of meaninglessness while discouraging young scholars from pursuing critical research on high-level diplomacy.

In our seminar meetings, we will analyze historical writings and debates, considering how their authors define historical themes, subjects/actors, and processes, as well as the meanings of history for different audiences and eras.","enrolmentPreferences":"This course is designed for junior and senior History majors; sophomores may enroll with instructor consent.","crossListing":["HIST 301"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"020241","department":"HIST","number":302,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1739,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Islamic Law: Past And Present","titleShort":"Islamic Law","instructors":[{"id":5583,"name":"Saadia Yacoob"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"11:20","end":"12:35","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Weekly responses, midterm essay, final essay","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"From fear of the Shari'a to its implementation in so called \"Islamic countries,\" Islamic law is perhaps best associated with draconian punishments and the oppression of women.

While the Nile seems eternal and almost beyond time and place, now in the 21st century, the Nile River is at a historical turning point. The water level and quality is dwindling while at the same time the number of people who rely on the river is ever increasing. This alarming nexus of demography, climate change, and economic development has led to increasingly urgent questions of the Nile´s future. Is the Nile dying? How has the river, and people´s relationship with it, changed over the last century? This course will consider the history of the Nile and and its built and natural environment. After a brief overview of the role of the river in ancient Egypt, we will explore the modern political and cultural history of the Nile. By following an imaginary droplet flowing from tributaries until it makes its way into the Mediterranean Sea, we will learn about the diverse peoples and cultures along the way. We will evaluate the numerous attempts to manage and control the Nile, including the building of big dams, and the continuous efforts to utilize the river for economic development such as agriculture and the tourism industry. At the end of the semester we will consider the relationship of the major urban centers with the Nile and whether the tensions among Nile riparian states will lead to \"water wars\" in East Africa and the Middle East.","enrolmentPreferences":"History and Arabic Studies majors","crossListing":["ENVI 335","GBST 320","HIST 308","AFR 350","ARAB 308"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021041","department":"HIST","number":309,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3859,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Fire And Ice: The History Of Modern Iceland","titleShort":"Modern Iceland","instructors":[{"id":2250,"name":"Magnús T.

Commanding unprecedented resources and administering a population of 100 to 150 million at its zenith--much larger than any European empire in the early modern world--the Mughals established a centralized administration, with a vast complex of personnel, money, and information networks. Mughal emperors were also political and cultural innovators of global repute. Moreover, while the Mughal dynasty was brought to an end with British colonial rule over India in 1857, the Mughal administrative structures and cultural influences continued to have a lasting impact on the British and later Indian states that followed. Centered around the intersection of the themes of power, patronage of art and architecture and religion, this course will ask: What factors contributed to the durability of the Mughal Empire for three centuries? How did global trade and innovations in taxation contribute to its wealth and stability? How did this dynasty of Muslim monarchs rule over diverse, and largely non-Muslim populations? How did they combine Persian cultural elements with regional ones to establish an empire that was truly Indian in nature? How were the Mughals viewed in their contemporary world of gunpowder empires like the Safavids of Persia and the Ottomans of Turkey? Readings will include the best of the recent scholarship on this vastly influential empire and a rich collection of primary sources, including emperor's memoirs, accounts of European travelers, and racy biographies, which will allow students make their own analysis. They will also have the opportunity to interpret paintings (some of which are held in the WCMA collections) and architecture. They will also discuss how the Mughals are remembered in South Asian film and music.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors and potential History majors","crossListing":["ASIA 312","GBST 312","HIST 312","REL 312"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017441","department":"HIST","number":319,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1902,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Gender And The Family In Chinese History","titleShort":"Gender\u0026Family Chinese History","instructors":[{"id":1992,"name":"Anne Reinhardt"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"08:30","end":"09:45","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active participation in discussions and group work, short skills-based writing assignments (2-4 pgs) and short essays (5-7 pgs) leading toward a final paper (10-15 pages).","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None; open to first year-students with instructors permission","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Although sometimes claimed as part of a set of immutable \"Asian values,\" the Chinese family has not remained fixed or stable over time.

Although James VI of Scotland ascended both the English and Irish thrones as James I in 1603, it was only in 1707 that the Acts of Union united the two separate kingdoms of Scotland and England into one nation, Great Britain. And it was only in 1800 that further Acts of Union brought Ireland into the fold, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This would itself only last until 1922 when, after bloody civil war, Ireland was partitioned, leaving only the northern six counties remaining in the United Kingdom. Largely through discussion, this course will explore the troubled making and unmaking of the United Kingdom since 1689. After considering the meaning of the nation, nationalism, and national identity, it will focus on specific moments in the history of that making and unmaking. Topics will include: the revolution of 1688-89 and subsequent Scottish Highland support for the discredited Jacobites (followers of ousted monarch, James II); Anglo-Scottish commercial interests that fueled the Acts of Union in 1707; the defeat of the Jacobites in the last battle on British soil in 1746; Anglo-Irish relations in the eighteenth century that fueled the creation of the United Kingdom in 1800 against the backdrop of the French Revolution; the nineteenth-century movement for Irish Home Rule, culminating in the Easter Rising in 1916 and the partition of the island; the more recent resurgence of Scottish and Welsh nationalism, leading to the establishment of the Welsh and Scottish parliaments and a referendum on Scottish independence; and, finally, the current dilemma of Northern Ireland. Although primarily a political history of the four nations that comprise the United Kingdom, the course will also focus on the cultural meanings of Britishness in the eighteenth century, the imperial dimensions of national belonging in the nineteenth century, multi-racial attempts to recast Britishness against the backdrop of postwar imperial decline, and recent, right-wing formations of Englishness in the context of the fragmentation of the United Kingdom and Britain's exit from the European Union.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference given to History majors","crossListing":["HIST 328"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"018974","department":"HIST","number":336,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1908,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"National-Socialist Germany","titleShort":"National-Socialist Germany","instructors":[{"id":2191,"name":"Thomas A.

Moving from \"time out of mind\" to the early nineteenth century, it examines ecological, cultural, political, economic, intellectual, and spiritual transits as well as exchanges among Indigenous/Native American, African and African American, Asian and Asian American, and Euro-colonial people. It introduces conceptual dimensions of this Atlantic paradigm and case studies that illuminate its human subtleties, with the goal of examining \"early American\" history through a transnational and transoceanic lens. The course takes an interdisciplinary approach to these intertwined histories, and reckons with how the very construction of \"history\" has, at different turns, affected what is shared, known, valued, and commemorated--or overwritten, denied, or seemingly silenced. Attentive to the structures of power that inflect every part of Atlantic histories, it offers specific ethical frameworks for approaching these topics. Blending methods grounded in oral traditions and histories, place-based knowledge systems, documentary/written archives, songs, archaeology, material culture, and other forms of expression and representation, it traces pathways for recasting the nature and meanings of these connected spaces and histories. In addition, the course consistently connects historical experiences with the twenty-first century, and how communities today are grappling with the afterlives and ongoing effects of these Atlantic pasts through calls to action for reparations, repatriation and rematriation, Land Back, climate justice, and other forms of accountability. The course also provides an opportunity to engage with original materials pertaining to Atlantic World histories in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum.","enrolmentPreferences":"Sophomore, junior, and senior History majors","crossListing":["AMST 360","HIST 361"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019191","department":"HIST","number":366,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1663,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"What They Saw In America","titleShort":"What They Saw In America","instructors":[{"id":2217,"name":"James L.

Those new nations were swept up in the Cold War competition in ways that profoundly influenced their paths to independence and their postcolonial orders, but they often had transformative effects on the Soviet-American rivalry as well. In this course, students will focus on two related questions: How did decolonization influence the Cold War and the international behavior and priorities of the two superpowers?

The years (1842-1943) in which these treaties were in effect is often called \"The Century of Humiliation\" by contemporary Chinese nationalists: a period of weakness that the rising Chinese nation still strives to overcome. The system imposed by these nineteenth century treaties, however, was a complex amalgam of legal, commercial, and residence privileges for foreigners in China that played a significant role in shaping the modern nation. One the most recognizable features of this system was the treaty \u003cI\u003eport\u003c/I\u003e--an urban center designated as open to foreign residence, trade, and shipping. Extending from an initial five open ports to nearly fifty by the turn of the century, these ports became commercial and industrial centers that connected China to the global economy and created novel spaces of culture, labor, society, and politics. In this research seminar, we will use of several recent online collections of English-language primary source material to investigate the role of the treaty system and the treaty ports in modern Chinese history. The seminar will begin with an exploration of the historiography of the treaty system and \"foreign presence\" and culminate in an original research paper on a related topic of each student's choice. Throughout, we will work on general and specific research methods.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior History majors, History majors, Asian Studies concentrators","crossListing":["HIST 417","ASIA 417"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022346","department":"HIST","number":422,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1524,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Festivities In The Early Modern World: Performance, Knowledge, And Difference","titleShort":"Early Modern Festivities","instructors":[{"id":9476,"name":"Alexander Bevilacqua"}],"meetings":[{"days":"T","start":"10:00","end":"12:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Engaged participation in discussions; in-class presentation; proposal and bibliography; research paper.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"For undergraduates, at least two prior courses in or related to History or Art History.","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"In 1860, Jacob Burckhardt put festivals at the center of his influential study of Renaissance Italy.

In this seminar we will seek to establish why festivities were so intrinsic to early modern culture, and what work they did. To what extent was performing a form of knowledge? How did festivity mediate early global interaction? We will consider, moreover, the many ways in which ephemeral events were commemorated in paintings and prints, and to what extent historians can recapture the early modern festivity today. Beyond Europe, we will investigate how the festival cultures of the Americas, of Africa, and of Asia interacted with European festival traditions, whether in Goa, Pernambuco, or Mexico City. Ultimately, we will ask: what might an early modern cultural history focused on festivities reveal? We will approach this history through a combination of primary materials drawn from the holdings of Williams College's Chapin Library and secondary readings, which will range from classics in the field to the most recent scholarship. Students will take turns delivering presentations on preselected objects of the week.

Tangible items like clothing, furniture, tools, and the built environment are all shaped by communities' identities, aspirations, resources, struggles, and forms of power. This course approaches North American histories through the lens of materiality, and examines how interdisciplinary methodologies can illuminate multiple or alternate understandings of the past--and its continuing impacts in the twenty-first century. While many historians emphasize written archives and documents as primary sources, scholars and practitioners of material culture studies center everyday as well as exceptional material items that communities have produced and interacted with over many generations. Equally important are the afterlives of these items. At different turns, and across time, social groups have cherished certain belongings; contested, rejected, or remade them; ascribed and activated meanings that may be very different from what the original makers conceived. These continuing transits compel reckoning with major issues of justice, rights, restitution, and sovereignty. The course traces key theories, ethics, and practices of caretaking, preservation, repatriation, curation, creative re-making, and digitization. Members will participate in a series of visits to area museums, collections, and meaningful places to deepen skills of critical analysis. The scope of the course is North American and at times transoceanic. It also includes substantial focus on our location in the Northeast and local formations of materiality and memory, as well as topics in Native American and Indigenous Studies, settler colonialism, and decolonizing approaches. Class members will build familiarity with appropriate techniques for approaching and handling different forms of material culture. They will also cultivate skills for developing and carrying out an original research project; and explore diverse modes of analysis and expression for representing the stories of materials and the communities who engage with them.","enrolmentPreferences":"If overenrolled, junior and senior History and American Studies majors","crossListing":["AMST 455","HIST 455"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022074","department":"HIST","number":470,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3872,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Latinx Migrations: Stories And Histories","titleShort":"Latinx Migrations","instructors":[{"id":1815,"name":"Carmen T.

While these are important, the voices of the people leaving their home countries and coming to the United States can be lost or buried. During the 1970s, the emerging subfield of social history asserted the need to craft histories that took into consideration the everyday lives of everyday people. Oral history emerged a key tool in capturing the personal stories too often missed in historical archives. At the same time, Puerto Rican Studies, Chicano Studies, and later, Latinx Studies emerged to tell the histories of groups too often omitted from or misrepresented in the scholarship. These fields relied on traditions of testimonios or storytelling. This course focuses on Latinx oral histories, autobiographies, memoirs, testimonios, and other first-person narratives to explore how people are impacted by and experience those broad historical contexts, as well as how the decisions they make and the actions they take shape those broad historical contexts. As Latinx Studies is a field that has been at the forefront of exploring intersectionality, we also analyze how attention to first person narratives and lived experiences reveal the complexities of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, as well as other visible and invisible markers of difference. Examining first person narratives in the context of specific Latinx groups in particular historical, geographical, and social contexts, we interrogate the methodological and interpretive challenges of working with oral histories and other first-person primary sources. Course topics include the gendered dimensions of migration, geopolitics and stories of exile, and the connections between lived experiences and political activism, particularly the feminist activism of the late 1960s and 1970s-- all while students develop and share their own research topics.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors, WGSS majors, and Latina/o Studies concentrators, seniors","crossListing":["WGSS 470","HIST 470","LATS 470"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022137","department":"HIST","number":488,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1915,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Sites Of Memory And American Wars","titleShort":"Sites Of Memory And Amer Wars","instructors":[{"id":2121,"name":"Karen R.

This tutorial asks: what racial ideas and practices preceded the Enlightenment? Beginning in the late Middle Ages, Europeans participated in enormous economic and cultural transformations, including increased global mobility and the establishment of new, transoceanic empires. Intensified interactions with people in the Americas, Africa, and Asia shaped European understandings of human difference, as did the burgeoning Atlantic economy and its cruelties. In this tutorial, we will place the emergence of modern racism in a long-term perspective, reconstructing the deep history out of which Enlightenment racial theory emerged. Proceeding both chronologically and thematically, we will consider how the major global transformations of the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries shaped European racial understandings with enduring consequence. In the process, we will develop a conceptual vocabulary to describe in a historically sensitive manner how embodied human difference has been interpreted differently across space and time. Throughout, we will read a variety of historical primary sources in conjunction with recent scholarship. Ultimately, our historical study will afford a comparative perspective on contemporary views of races and racism.","enrolmentPreferences":"Junior and seniors; History majors.","crossListing":["HIST 492"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011550","department":"HIST","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1916,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Research Seminar","titleShort":"Sr Hist Thesis Research Sem","instructors":[{"id":3039,"name":"Aparna Kapadia"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TF","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Class participation and completed written work, and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Limited to seniors accepted into the History Department's Thesis Program","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This seminar is intended solely for writers of senior theses during their first semester.

Amar recasts the debate over whether America has a \"living Constitution,\" a debate usually revolving around whether change in constitutional meaning requires resort to the formal amendment process or can be achieved through judicial interpretation. Amar supports the latter view, but proposes something far-reaching: history itself effectively amends the Constitution. Thus, for example, he argues that speeches by Martin Luther King and precedents set by George Washington, as well as the daily activities and assumptions of ordinary Americans, have become constitutional subtext requiring consideration when we interpret the Constitution. Is that notion convincing? Preposterous? A healthy way of understanding the inevitable intersection of law, history, and politics? A transparent excuse to read one's own views into the Constitution? Through a careful reading of Amar, and other important constitutional theorists, we will probe different ways of thinking about the supreme law of the land.","enrolmentPreferences":"Justice and Law Studies concentrators","crossListing":["JLST 401"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"016903","department":"JWST","number":217,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1888,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"The Modern Middle East","titleShort":"The Modern Middle East","instructors":[{"id":2250,"name":"Magnús T.

The imperative to keep a text, word, image, or concept in constant motion, in order to generate as many meanings and cross-meanings as possible, challenges us to transform the act of interpretation itself into a virtuosic craft or art that can engage the human imagination as diversely and powerfully as the creation of the works being interpreted. At the same time, emphasis on the dynamism between text and interpreter should dispel the notion that only expansive works have expansive meanings. If interpretation itself is an art, then even the shortest text can contain \"everything\" within it when it participates in that art. This course will engage students in a radical experiment in the art of interpretation. Through a deep encounter with a selection of miniature texts, ranging from ancient rabbinic proverbs and medieval fables to the modern parables and fragments of Franz Kafka, as well as folklore and jokelore from every period in Jewish history up to the present, we will develop an interpretive practice that combines analytic, critical, and creative principles in both written and oral contexts.

Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly. The course will help students understand the depth of Jewish life in the Maghreb and the Middle East, and interrogate the local and global factors that led to their disappearance from both social and cultural memories for a long time. Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world. Resisting both conflict and nostalgia as the primary determinants of Jewish-Muslim relations, the course will help students think about multiple ways in which Jews and Muslims formed communities of citizens despite their differences and disagreements.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students interested in critical and comparative literary, religious or historical studies.","crossListing":["ARAB 363","COMP 363","JWST 268","REL 268"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022335","department":"JWST","number":299,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3724,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Shakespeare'S Torah","titleShort":"Shakespeare'S Torah","instructors":[{"id":3019,"name":"Jeffrey I.

His plays and poems have shaped the linguistic, philosophical, and artistic representation of human experience in ways that permeate every aspect of our lives. Shakespeare's capacious work and its central preoccupation with the essential questions of humanity have also inspired an extensive tradition of commentary, interpretation, and performance. In this regard, his work occupies a position similar to the one held by the collection of writings known in the Jewish tradition as \u003cI\u003eTorah\u003c/I\u003e. This term refers both to the set of books contained in the Hebrew Bible and to the rabbinic tradition that emerged from reading those books, which in turn has provided the core principles for over two millennia of Jewish interpretive practice. This course invites students to read Shakespeare as Torah by applying the essential features of that practice to his extraordinary work. Through a deep and sustained encounter with four plays in four different genres (\u003cI\u003eHamlet\u003c/I\u003e, \u003cI\u003eHenry IV\u003c/I\u003e, \u003cI\u003eTwelfth Night\u003c/I\u003e, and \u003cI\u003eThe Tempest\u003c/I\u003e), we will combine analytic, critical, and creative principles to make meaning in and out of these texts.

As scholars in disability studies argue, self-representations of disabled individuals carry the potential for us as a society to move beyond the binary narratives of \"tragedy or inspiration\" so often associated with disability. Rather, the self-produced narratives of US disabled writers of color offer a much more nuanced portrayal of everyday life with disability/ies for the multiply marginalized.

Im/migration and refugee policies have long defined who is eligible to enter and how, as well as who is deemed eligible for citizenship and belonging.

We will look at the use of ethnic and racial formations as a bridge between cultural and political geography in the contemporary US immigration landscape. Through an interdisciplinary exploration of 'migration,' we will examine the depth and range of migrants' experiences and how these communities' lives are structured through various axes of difference, such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and documentation status. We will consider how gender and sexuality structure racial formations and determine notions of value. We will give attention to the variegated landscape of immigration enforcement and its relationship to issues of labor, political economy, and environmental justice, among others. Through materials that embrace both historical and contemporary perspectives, this course will help students develop a critical understanding of how space matters when considering transnational processes of migration as well as migrant communities' cultural place-making practices throughout the US.

While these are important, the voices of the people leaving their home countries and coming to the United States can be lost or buried. During the 1970s, the emerging subfield of social history asserted the need to craft histories that took into consideration the everyday lives of everyday people. Oral history emerged a key tool in capturing the personal stories too often missed in historical archives. At the same time, Puerto Rican Studies, Chicano Studies, and later, Latinx Studies emerged to tell the histories of groups too often omitted from or misrepresented in the scholarship. These fields relied on traditions of testimonios or storytelling. This course focuses on Latinx oral histories, autobiographies, memoirs, testimonios, and other first-person narratives to explore how people are impacted by and experience those broad historical contexts, as well as how the decisions they make and the actions they take shape those broad historical contexts. As Latinx Studies is a field that has been at the forefront of exploring intersectionality, we also analyze how attention to first person narratives and lived experiences reveal the complexities of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, as well as other visible and invisible markers of difference. Examining first person narratives in the context of specific Latinx groups in particular historical, geographical, and social contexts, we interrogate the methodological and interpretive challenges of working with oral histories and other first-person primary sources. Course topics include the gendered dimensions of migration, geopolitics and stories of exile, and the connections between lived experiences and political activism, particularly the feminist activism of the late 1960s and 1970s-- all while students develop and share their own research topics.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors, WGSS majors, and Latina/o Studies concentrators, seniors","crossListing":["HIST 470","LATS 470","WGSS 470"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"017808","department":"LATS","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1228,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Honors Thesis: Latina/O Studies","titleShort":"SrHon Thesis: Latina/O Studies","instructors":[{"id":1815,"name":"Carmen T.

Exploration of these and other questions will lead us to examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership, congressional-executive interactions, social movement and interest group relations, and media interactions. Attention will focus largely on the modern, twentieth and twenty-first century, presidency, though older historical examples will also be used to help us gain perspective on these problems.","enrolmentPreferences":"Political Science majors and Leadership studies concentrators","crossListing":["LEAD 218","PSCI 218"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"011973","department":"LEAD","number":225,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3679,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"International Security","titleShort":"International Security","instructors":[{"id":10239,"name":"Galen E Jackson"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MWF","start":"11:00","end":"12:15","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Class participation, two 6- to 8-page papers, final","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This is a course about war and peace.

Music both echoed and helped shape political views and, therefore, prompted various forms of regulation and censorship (McCarthyism in the U.S.; the Union of Soviet Composers). To counter Soviet claims of American cultural inferiority and racism, the U.S. sponsored numerous musical diplomacy efforts showcasing both jazz (Armstrong; Ellington; Brubeck) and classical musicians and composers (Bernstein; American orchestras). Cold War politics and the threat of nuclear war influenced musical styles (Copland; Soviet Socialist Realism; the popular American folk music revival; serialism; rock behind the Iron Curtain), specific musical events (Tokyo East West Music Encounter; concerts celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall), and individual careers (Shostakovich; Robeson; Van Cliburn). To investigate music's political roles and capacity for expressing communist and democratic capitalist ideologies, we will adopt a case study approach. The Cold War was a global political and, frequently, militaristic struggle. Though our focus will be on music in the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A., we will also consider musical developments impacted by the Cold War throughout Western and Eastern Europe, in Latin America, and in East Asia.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students with relevant experience in Political Science, History, or Music studies.","crossListing":["LEAD 239","MUS 239"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021389","department":"LEAD","number":254,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1897,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Sovereignty, Resistance, And Resilience: Native American Histories To 1865","titleShort":"Native American Histories","instructors":[{"id":11198,"name":"Christine DeLucia"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"Lecture With Small- And Whole-Group Discussions","classReqEval":"Attendance at lectures, active participation in class discussion, midterm exam, short essays based on readings and discussion topics, museum/archives exercise, final essay/project.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course surveys Native American/Indigenous North American histories from beginnings through the mid-nineteenth century, tracing the complex ways that sovereign tribal nations and communities have shaped Turtle Island/North America.

It also introduces foundational methodologies in Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS) and strategies for pursuing decolonizing scholarship and action. Emphasis is on primary and secondary works produced by Indigenous authors/creators. Starting with the diversity of Indigenous societies that have inhabited and cared for lands and waters since \"time out of mind,\" it foregrounds the complexity of Native peoples, nations, and worldviews situated in particular homelands, as well as accounts of origins and migrations. It addresses how societies confronted devastating epidemics resulting from the \"Columbian Exchange,\" and contended with Euro-colonial processes of colonization, extraction, and enslavement. Indigenous nations' multifaceted efforts to maintain sovereignty and homelands through pervasive violence, attempted genocide, and dispossession are addressed, as well as forms of relations and kinship with African-American and Afro-Indigenous people. It concludes with how different communities negotiated the tumultuous eras of the American Revolution, forced removal in the 1830s, and Civil War, and created pathways for endurance, self-determination, and security in its aftermath. The course centers on Indigenous actors--intellectuals, diplomats, legal strategists, knowledge keepers, spiritual leaders, artists, and many others--and consistently connects historical events with present-day matters of land, historical memory, education, caretaking, and activism. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to engage with original materials in the Williams College Archives/Special Collections and Art Museum. While the scope of the course is continental and transoceanic, it devotes significant attention to the Native Northeast and the Stockbridge-Munsee Mohican homelands in which Williams College is located.","enrolmentPreferences":"History and American Studies majors, followed by first- and second-year students","crossListing":["AMST 254","HIST 254","LEAD 254"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"010464","department":"LEAD","number":301,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3497,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Museums: History And Practice","titleShort":"Museums: History And Practice","instructors":[{"id":2366,"name":"Michael Conforti"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:00","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Oral presentations and discussion in class and one seminar paper (with class presentation) at the end of the semester","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Undergraduates should email michael.conforti@williams.edu to schedule a discussion before registering for the course","departmentNotes":"Satisfies the seminar requirement for the undergraduate Art History major","descriptionSearch":"Art museums express the cultural, aesthetic and social ideals of their period of formation and many of those ideals are embedded in the values and practices of institutions today. Comparing institutions past and present internationally, seminar participants will envision the art museum's future while addressing programmatic and organizational challenges at this moment of participatory civic engagement and social, political unrest. With growing skepticism of institutional collecting practices and authoritative narratives, art museums, especially those in the United States, face internal and external pressure to \"decolonize\" as they attempt to alter their canon. There is pressure, as well, to embrace a more active role in climate and social justice movements. It is a time marked by calls for compensation transparency, participatory decision making, staff and trustee diversity, and greater scrutiny of funders. The seminar will consider this environment against past and current norms of governance, management and curatorial policies and practices. We will examine the traditional role of architecture and installation in interpretation and experience, prevailing and proposed guidelines in the accessioning and deaccessioning of works of art and both internal and external attitudes towards the repatriation and restitution of cultural property. Studying museums ranging in size and type from the \"encyclopedic\" to newly established contemporary arts institutions and alternative spaces, seminar participants will hear how museum leaders are dealing with challenges to current practice through weekly zoom sessions. Participants will also ponder how future museums might strive to balance the institution's traditional scholarly and artistic role with new civic and social responsibilities, mindful of financial stability in a market-driven, metric-conscious, not-for-profit environment; doing so while addressing, in proposed program and practice, the demands on museums emanating from a more ethically insistent internal and external world.","enrolmentPreferences":"Graduate students, then senior art history majors, then other undergraduates","crossListing":["ARTH 401","ARTH 501","LEAD 301"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021415","department":"LEAD","number":332,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1711,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"New York City Politics: The Urban Crisis To The Pandemic","titleShort":"New York City Politics","instructors":[{"id":5659,"name":"Mason B.

By the early 21st century, the city had largely met these challenges and was once again one of the most diverse and economically vital places on earth-but also one marked by profound inequality. This course will examine how New Yorkers have contested core issues of capitalism and democracy-how those contests have played out as the city itself has changed and how they have shaped contemporary New York. Broad themes will include the city's role as a showcase for neoliberalism, neoconservatism, technocratic centrism, and progressivism; the politics of race, immigration, and belonging; the relation of city, state, and national governments; and the sources of contemporary forms of inequality.

Then, we will look at some important factors that shape how followers approach would-be leaders: inequality and economic precarity; identity and group consciousness; notions of membership, community, and hierarchy; and declining local institutions. While the course will focus primarily on the United States, our conceptual framework will be global; though our main interest will be contemporary, we will also examine previous eras in which democratic leadership has come under great pressure. Our primary questions will be these: Why does transformative leadership seem so difficult today? How does political leadership in the 21st century differ from leadership in earlier eras?

Doing so will help us consider how literature both plays into and subverts dominant viewpoints of the ocean. Through texts that consider 19th-century whaling, the Middle Passage, the postcolonial Caribbean, and islands throughout the Pacific Ocean, we will explore a range of questions, including: What can we learn from examining efforts to write about the ocean? How do ocean stories help individuals understand themselves, their communities, and their place in global environments? What can the range of cultural and literary perspectives on our \"single, global ocean\" reveal about the ways different people are both connected with and profoundly distant from each other?

Genres covered in the course vary intermittently but often include: \"throat singing\" genres in Tuva and Sardinia, Zimbabwean mbira and Chimurenga music, Argentine Tango, Ghanaian azonto and highlife, Balinese gamelan, and North Indian classical music.

We will begin by defining the concepts of \"colonialism\" and \"imperialism\" in order to understand how such political and socio-economic power structures developed and attempted to exert control and influence over subjugated populations--and consequently over their music. From there, we will investigate some of the musical developments and repertories that resulted from these efforts through a series of modules on various territories colonized by Spain, including the Spanish territories of Naples/southern Italy, New Spain, and the Philippines.

How is music used to define social groups and negotiate identity, gender, and class? Which musical characteristics are associated with Arab \"heritage\" and \"modernity,\" and how are these performed? In what ways does music shape everyday life in the Arab world?

These forms are shaped by the impact of religion, colonialism, national political movements, travel, immigration, and the continuing emergence of technology. In South Africa, the labor conditions of miners instigated the creation of Isicathulo, Gum boots, and in Brazil the history of colonialism is a factor that anchors Samba as a sustaining cultural and socioeconomic force. The birth of Hip Hop in the 20th century finds populations across the globe using its music, dance, lyrics, and swagger as a vehicle for individual and group voice. Hip Hop thrives as a cultural presence in most countries of the African continent and in the Americas. We will examine the factors that moved this form from the Bronx, New York, to Johannesburg, South Africa, and Rio, Brazil. We will examine at least two of these forms learning dance and music technique and composition material that will inform their practice. Each of these genres generated new physical practices, new and enduring communities while continuing to embody specific histories that have moved beyond their place of origin.

In this course, we will examine the material and technological history of hip hop culture, with particular attention to hip hop's tendency to sample, remix, mash-up, and repurpose existing media artifacts to create new works or art. We will use a media archaeological approach to examine the precise material conditions that first gave rise to graffiti art, deejaying, rapping, and breakdancing, and to analyze hip hop songs, videos, and films. Media archaeology is a critical and artistic practice that seeks to interpret the layers of significance embedded in cultural artifacts. How does hip hop archaeology remix the past, the present, and the future? How do the historical, political, and cultural coding of hip hop artifacts change as they increasingly become part of institutional collections, from newly established hip hop archives at Cornell and Harvard to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture?","enrolmentPreferences":"AMST majors or prospective majors","crossListing":["AFR 222","AMST 222","ENGL 221","MUS 223"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011760","department":"MUS","number":231,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1080,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Music In History I: Music And Culture From Antiquity To 1750","titleShort":"Music Hist: Antiquity To 1750","instructors":[{"id":14430,"name":"Elizabeth G.

In doing so, the course introduces the modern study of music history, sampling a broad range of recent scholarship reflecting an array of critical approaches to the study of early music in our own day. Weekly coursework will include readings on music historical topics, as well as listening and score analysis of key repertory in modern transcription.

From economic expansions to developing trade routes and from violent religious crusades to flourishing universities, cities, and courts, opportunities for cultural investment and exchange among regions in Western Europe, North Africa, and Central and East Asia were plentiful, if not always peaceful. In this seminar, we will consider how a global historical perspective shifts our understanding of music in the Middle Ages from one based on hegemonic European progress in isolation to one that reveals a multitude of influences, interactions, and interconnections among people of various cultures, races, and religions both within and outside of the European continent. Through a series of case studies, we will address how and where these global interconnections took place and what musical practices flourished as a result. We will give special consideration to the following topics: orality and literacy, race and difference, the politics of religion, economic power, and manuscript culture. Coursework will include weekly readings on musical and broader historical topics, listening and score analysis of key repertory in modern transcription, and study of original notation through manuscript facsimiles. Students should be comfortable reading music notation.","enrolmentPreferences":"Music majors, those planning to major in music, and any student with a strong background and interest in music","crossListing":["MUS 235"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021752","department":"MUS","number":239,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3082,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Music In The Global Cold War","titleShort":"Music In The Global Cold War","instructors":[{"id":2162,"name":"W.

Music both echoed and helped shape political views and, therefore, prompted various forms of regulation and censorship (McCarthyism in the U.S.; the Union of Soviet Composers). To counter Soviet claims of American cultural inferiority and racism, the U.S. sponsored numerous musical diplomacy efforts showcasing both jazz (Armstrong; Ellington; Brubeck) and classical musicians and composers (Bernstein; American orchestras). Cold War politics and the threat of nuclear war influenced musical styles (Copland; Soviet Socialist Realism; the popular American folk music revival; serialism; rock behind the Iron Curtain), specific musical events (Tokyo East West Music Encounter; concerts celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall), and individual careers (Shostakovich; Robeson; Van Cliburn). To investigate music's political roles and capacity for expressing communist and democratic capitalist ideologies, we will adopt a case study approach. The Cold War was a global political and, frequently, militaristic struggle. Though our focus will be on music in the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A., we will also consider musical developments impacted by the Cold War throughout Western and Eastern Europe, in Latin America, and in East Asia.","enrolmentPreferences":"Students with relevant experience in Political Science, History, or Music studies.","crossListing":["LEAD 239","MUS 239"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011755","department":"MUS","number":252,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1065,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Introduction To The Music Of John Coltrane","titleShort":"John Coltrane","instructors":[{"id":5553,"name":"Kris Allen"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In-class participation including small quizzes, midterm, class presentation, and final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"MUS 103 and/or 203 strongly recommended; musical literacy sufficient to deal with the material and /or permission of instructor","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This course offers the serious music student an opportunity to study the unique body of work produced by saxophonist and composer John Coltrane (1926-1967).

Drawing from a number of case studies from throughout Africa and the African Diaspora, we will first endeavor to understand and contextualize issues related to education, social uplift, the environment, and the economy as they relate to specific communities. We will then examine how a series of organizations (from grassroots campaigns to multinational initiatives) utilize the performing arts in response to those issues.\nAmong the issues we will discuss at length are:\n-How do performers and organizations navigate the interplay between showcasing the performance talents of individuals and groups and foregrounding an issue or cause? More broadly, what dilemmas emerge as social and aesthetic imperatives intermingle?\n-What are the dynamics between people acting on a local level within their communities and their various international partnerships and audiences?\n-How can government or NGO sponsorship help and/or hinder systemic change?\nBy the end of the semester, students will be equipped with conceptual frameworks and critical vocabularies that can help them ascertain the functions of performance within larger organizations and in service to complex societal issues. Throughout the course, we will watch and listen to a variety of performances from traditional genres to hip-hop, however this class is less about learning to perform or analyze any particular genre than it is about thinking through how performance is used as a vehicle for social change.\nCase studies will include youth outreach and uplift in Tanzania through the United African Alliance, campaigns to promote girls' education in Benin and Zimbabwe, community-wide decolonizing initiatives through the Yole!Africa Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the cultural reclamation of a mining town in Suriname through the arts organization, Stichting Kibii.","enrolmentPreferences":"If the course exceeds the maximum enrollment, selection will be made based on students explanations for why they want to take the class.","crossListing":["DANC 323","MUS 323","THEA 321"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"011770","department":"MUS","number":381,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3091,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Choral Conducting","titleShort":"Choral Conducting","instructors":[{"id":13536,"name":"Anna C.

Sound and sight converge when we observe musicians performing in concert venues, patterns of notes and rhythms on the musical score, pictures and text on album and sheet music covers, moving images on screens in films, music videos, and video games. A programmatic work conjures specific images, even whole narratives, in our \"mind's eye,\" or imagination. A work of absolute music, such as a fugue or symphony, can do so as well, although what we envision here may be largely abstract. With hybrid genres, such as opera, musical theater, and dance, the musical and the visual jointly command our attention, often in a spectacular display. This seminar explores myriad ways that \"seeing\" mediates our experience of hearing, making, and understanding music. We will examine a broad range of topics, including synesthesia; visuality in performance and interpretation; visual metaphors such as line, color, and space in music analysis and criticism; music and representation; intersections between music and painting, sculpture, and architecture; operatic staging; illuminated music manuscripts; eye music and graphic notation; and sound and image in digital media.","enrolmentPreferences":"Junior and senior music majors, and any student with a demonstrated interest in music","crossListing":["MUS 475"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"011793","department":"MUS","number":491,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3095,"consent":"D","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Advanced Musical Performance","titleShort":"Advanced Musical Performance","instructors":[{"id":2255,"name":"Ed Gollin"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"Individual Instruction","classReqEval":"Lesson preparation, public performance, and progress throughout the semester.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Intended primarily for music majors.

First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception.

The worldview that underlies classical tragedy, however, seems markedly different from the one that we find in classical philosophy. While Plato and Aristotle differ on many points, they share the belief that the cosmos and the human place within it can be understood by rational means. Furthermore, they share the conviction that the most important components of a successful life are within the control of the individual human being. The picture that we find in the works of the tragedians, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides is markedly different. The tragedians emphasize the ways in which the cosmos and our role in it resists any attempt to be understood, and emphasize the ways in which the success or failure of our lives often turns on things completely beyond our control. The view of the tragedians can lead to a thoroughgoing nihilism according to which --the best thing of all [for a human being] is never to have born-but the next best thing is to die soon (Aristotle's \u003cI\u003eEudemus\u003c/I\u003e as quoted in Nietzsche's \u003cI\u003eBirth of Tragedy\u003c/I\u003e; see also Sophocles' \u003cI\u003eOedipus at Colonus\u003c/I\u003e).\" Despite these rather grim pronouncements, tragic drama has continued to fascinate and educate generations. Furthermore, philosophers have continued to revisit the existential questions vividly raised by Greek tragedy. In this course, we will examine a number of Greek tragedies and philosophical writing on tragedy and the tragic. We will read the \u003cI\u003eOresteia\u003c/I\u003e and \u003cI\u003ePrometheus Bound\u003c/I\u003e by Aeschylus, Sophocles' \u003cI\u003eTheban Cycle\u003c/I\u003e, and the \u003cI\u003eHippolytus, Bacchae and Philoctetes\u003c/I\u003e by Euripides. As we read through these plays, we will also examine a number of philosophical works about tragedy. We will begin with Aristotle's \u003cI\u003ePoetics\u003c/I\u003e and will continue with Hume's \u003cI\u003eOf Tragedy\u003c/I\u003e, Hegel's various writings on tragedy, and Nietzsche's \u003cI\u003eThe Birth of Tragedy\u003c/I\u003e.

The remainder of the course will consider key concepts at the core of medical ethics and central issues for the field, such as privacy and confidentiality, the distinction between killing and \"letting die,\" and therapy vs. research. To this end, each week we will (1) read philosophical material focused on one principle or concept, and (2) consider in detail one bioethics case in which the principle or concept has special application or relevance.

Existentialists investigate deeply irrational phenomena of human life, including anxiety, boredom, tragedy, melancholy, despair, death, faith, sexuality, love, alienation, hate, sadism, masochism, and authenticity.

Teleological judgments are likewise puzzling, since we often explain living things as designed for certain purposes (e.g., the hummingbird's long bill is for accessing nectar deep inside flowers) or as striving for certain goals (e.g., the sunflower turns toward the sun to take in energy), and yet we are committed to a scientific world-view, where nature is governed by mechanistic causal laws. Indeed, we sometimes describe human history as progressive (aiming toward greater rationality, morality, equality, or freedom, e.g.), even though we regard individual humans as free to choose whether to act well or poorly.

This push to identify systemic racism as a high priority in public health action and policy is an important symbolic and political move. It names the faults of histories, systems and institutions but also brings to the spotlight the individual and community responsibility to dismantle racism in the US. In this tutorial, we will examine racism in public health policy, practice and research through an investigation of several mediums of evidence and information, ranging from peer reviewed literature to news editorials, podcasts and documentaries. We will explore specific pathways by which legacies of colonialism and racism function in various public health disciplines such as epidemiology, social \u0026 behavioral sciences, health policy and environmental health while also examining the dynamics of power and history in research and community practice. We will take deep dives into issues on how health can be impacted by redlining, racist medical algorithms, racial trauma and stress and police violence, to name a few. Students will also have two opportunities to select their own case studies, as a way for you to research and learn about particular racial health issues that are of personal interest.\nThis course is also about self-reflection and exploration of the ways in which our identities and lived experiences impact our understanding and perspective. We will gain skills in speaking across differences and articulation of how our own perceptions and lived experiences of race and racism impact our study of public health. This tutorial requires an openness to self-reflection and the practice of listening and articulation.","enrolmentPreferences":"1-Public Health concentrators. 2- Asian American Studies concentrators.","crossListing":["AAS 351","PHLH 351"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020018","department":"PHLH","number":402,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3250,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Senior Seminar In Public Health","titleShort":"Senior Sem Public Health","instructors":[{"id":2166,"name":"Kiaran Honderich"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Active seminar participation, written reflections, contribution to the team research project, and a 12- to 15-page final paper","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Completion of at least four courses counting towards the PHLH concentration","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"The capstone seminar provides concentrators with the opportunity to reflect upon and synthesize their experiential learning in the context of understanding gained from a cohesive set of elective courses, and through the lens of a variety of intellectual and disciplinary frameworks.

Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it wrongly assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy.

Its first part examines major thinkers in relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers mid-20th-century writers who revise and critique economic liberalism from a variety of perspectives, including Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ronald Coase, Arthur Okun, and Albert O. Hirschman. The third part surveys significant topics relevant to the themes of the course, with applications to current public policy issues, such as: power relations and autonomy in the workplace; asymmetric information and social insurance; economic inequality and distributive justice; equality of opportunity; the economics of health care; positional goods and the moral foundations of capitalism; social media and addiction; economic nationalism; behavioral economics; climate change and intergenerational equity; finance and financial crises; and rent-seeking. The combination of the historical focus of the early part of the course with discussion of modern policy issues and debates in the latter part of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy.","enrolmentPreferences":"Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major","crossListing":["PSCI 238","ECON 299","POEC 250"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"010859","department":"POEC","number":253,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1118,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Empirical Methods In Political Economy","titleShort":"Empirical Methods In Pol Econ","instructors":[{"id":1823,"name":"Anand V.

Is it merely a practical way to meet our needs? Or is it, rather, the activity through which citizens pursue justice and the good life? And what is justice? How can it be established and secured? Where does it apply? To whom? What are the powers and obligations of citizenship? Who decides? On what basis? Political theory addresses questions such as these as it investigates the fundamental problems of how people can, do, and ought to live together.

Have some periods of American democratic politics been more amenable to particular kinds of leadership than others? What makes American political leadership distinctive in international comparison? Who, exactly, has been permitted to participate in American politics, and on what terms?

Critics argue that today's media is shallow and uninformative, a vector of misinformation, and a promoter of extremism and violence. Some defenders argue that the media is a convenient scapegoat for problems that are endemic to human societies, while others claim that it actually facilitates political action aimed at addressing long-ignored injustices. In addition to addressing this important question about the health of American democracy, students will learn how the traditional media and social media influences Americans' political attitudes and behaviors.

What are the limits on presidential power? How much do we attribute the shaping of politics to the agency of the individual in the office and to what extent are politics the result of structural, cultural, and institutional factors? Are the politics of the presidency different in foreign and domestic policy? How are national security concerns balanced with the protection of civil rights and liberties? How is the office and purpose of the presidency affected by an economic order predicated on private capital? By the character of the occupant? Exploration of these and other questions will lead us to examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership, congressional-executive interactions, social movement and interest group relations, and media interactions.

Do concerns about information security alter states' most basic political calculations? How can we expect cyberweapons to shape the future of warfare, intelligence, and security competition? How effective are strategies like cross-domain deterrence? Should the world try to regulate the use of these technologies and, if so, how exactly? The course begins with several sessions that provide a technical overview of key information security concepts and an examination of some prominent hacks. In addition, the beginning of the course will include several classes on the theoretical implications of the advent of the cyber age, as well as a brief historical overview of information security in the post-World War II period. From there, the course will cover a number of important topics and case studies, such as Stuxnet, NotPetya, cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, threats to critical infrastructure, misinformation, propaganda, election interference, the potential implications of quantum computing, and the prospects for the establishment of an international cyber arms control regime. In general, the course will focus on competition between some the world's premier cyber powers, such as China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, and the United States.","enrolmentPreferences":"Political Science majors, IR subfield","crossListing":["PSCI 222"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019684","department":"PSCI","number":224,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1702,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Neo-Liberalism: What Is It And Why Does It Matter?","titleShort":"Neo-Liberalism","instructors":[{"id":2233,"name":"Michael D.

Do nuclear weapons have an essentially stabilizing or destabilizing effect? How, if at all, do nuclear weapons affect how political disputes run their course? How significant of a threat are concerns like nuclear proliferation, nuclear terrorism, and nuclear accidents? How does a state's nuclear posture affect basic political outcomes? Is it possible to return to a world without nuclear weapons? The course will focus on these questions using an interdisciplinary perspective that leverages political science concepts, historical case studies, and contemporary policy debates to generate core insights. It will not only survey the history of the nuclear age--and of individual countries' nuclear development--but also grapple with important contemporary policy dilemmas in the nuclear realm.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference to students majoring in political science, particularly in the international relations subfield, and/or doing a concentration in leadership studies","crossListing":["PSCI 226","LEAD 226"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"011966","department":"PSCI","number":228,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3684,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"International Organization","titleShort":"International Organization","instructors":[{"id":1911,"name":"Cheryl Shanks"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"13:10","end":"14:25","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Two short papers, a presentation, one longer paper, one group project.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None, but the introduction to international politics (202) is strongly recommended.

Accompanying these interventions in the legal field is a deep and sustained inquiry into the subject of law: Who can appear before the law as the proper bearer of civil and human rights? What kinds of violations and deprivations can be recognized as harms in need of redress? Who gets to make these judgments, and according to what rules? While our examples will be drawn mainly from family law, the regulation of sex/reproduction, and workplace discrimination, the main task of this course will be to deepen our understanding of how the subject of law is constituted. Illustrative cases to aid our inquiry will be drawn primarily from the USA and Canada, with additional examples from India, South Africa, and possibly European law.

Before his death in 1950 at the young age of forty six, Orwell produced a stunningly large and diverse body of work in the fields of journalism, literature, and political commentary. Much of this work was inspired by his own experiences as a police officer in Burma, several years working and traveling with destitute workers in England and France, as well as his experiences fighting against fascism during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. While a fairly obscure and struggling author for much of his life, Orwell achieved worldwide fame after the Second World War with the publication of Animal Farm (1945) and 1984 (1949).\nThis tutorial has two main objectives. First, it will introduce students to Orwell's most important books and essays in the context of a turbulent political era marked by the Great Depression, the rise of totalitarianism, world war, and the emerging Cold War. Second, the tutorial will examine the past and ongoing uses and abuses of Orwell's legacy by scholars and analysts on both the political left and the right. As Louis Menand argues, \"almost everything in the popular understanding of Orwell is a distortion of what he really thought and the kind of writer he was.\" The course will conclude by examining what Orwell's thought contributes to a consideration of current issues ranging from the emergence of cancel culture to the possibilities of democratic socialism in the 21st century.","enrolmentPreferences":"Declared and prospective political science majors.","crossListing":["PSCI 259"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022124","department":"PSCI","number":261,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1706,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"The Arab-Israeli Conflict","titleShort":"The Arab-Israeli Conflict","instructors":[{"id":10239,"name":"Galen E Jackson"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Biweekly response papers; Biweekly critiques of partner's response papers; Class participation; Final analytical essay","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"This tutorial will cover the Arab-Israeli dispute--from both historical and political science perspectives--from the rise of the Zionist movement in the late nineteenth century to the present day.

Are these conflicts related, and if so, how? Does how Americans define themselves as a nation inform the shape of the American state and the types of policies it creates? Or is it the reverse? Does the state and its policies make the nation, as many scholars claim? This tutorial investigates the relationship between state and nation over time in the United States. We will explore conflicts over how \"the people\" are defined in different moments, and we will examine how these conflicts connect to the exercise of state power in areas including territorial expansion, census taking, public health, immigration, social welfare, and policing.","enrolmentPreferences":"Political science majors","crossListing":["PSCI 307"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021415","department":"PSCI","number":310,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1710,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"New York City Politics: The Urban Crisis To The Pandemic","titleShort":"New York City Politics","instructors":[{"id":5659,"name":"Mason B.

In the mid-1970s, New York was a poster child of urban crisis, plagued by arson and housing abandonment, crime, the loss of residents and jobs, and failing public services. By the early 21st century, the city had largely met these challenges and was once again one of the most diverse and economically vital places on earth-but also one marked by profound inequality. This course will examine how New Yorkers have contested core issues of capitalism and democracy-how those contests have played out as the city itself has changed and how they have shaped contemporary New York. Broad themes will include the city's role as a showcase for neoliberalism, neoconservatism, technocratic centrism, and progressivism; the politics of race, immigration, and belonging; the relation of city, state, and national governments; and the sources of contemporary forms of inequality. Specific topics will include policing, school reform, and gentrification.

To examine this claim, the readings will address two fundamental issues. First, it will consider the the terms of American foreign policy after the Cold War, how it sets these, and continuities and discontinuities between the Clinton and Bush administrations. Where did Democratic and Republican foreign policy elites agree and disagree and what happened to proposals that were outside the elite consensus? Second, the course will consider the prelude and official responses to the 2008-11 financial crisis.

Marcuse famously supported the aims of student activism, feminism, black liberation movements and Third World anti-colonialism during that period, publicly affirming their efforts to integrate ethical idealism with concrete concerns for the economic wellbeing and political freedom of oppressed groups. Drawing on Freud, and challenged by his philosophical exchanges with Angela Davis, Marcuse came to the view that these movements were addressing not only material deprivations such as poverty and structural oppression, but also the effects of social alienation and a damaged psychic life. He saw these movements as successfully bridging the longstanding tension between the ideal elements of our humanity and the physical conditions for human existence (a tension represented in philosophy by the contrast between Kant and Marx). Yet he stopped short of identifying new social movements with the Marxist notion of a revolutionary class. Why this hesitation? Was his caution warranted? To provide a broader context for Marcuse's critical theory, we will read a selection of his writings alongside related texts by Kant, Marx, Freud, and Davis. Looking at but also beyond his political solidarity with the emancipatory movements of the 1960s, we will then consider how Marcuse's work can be placed in conversation with more recent critical theory, including ideas emerging from the Occupy Wall Street movement and feminist approaches to aesthetics and psychoanalytic theory.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior Political Science majors with concentration in Political Theory, then other Political Science majors","crossListing":["PSCI 432"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022125","department":"PSCI","number":442,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1718,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Senior Seminar: Authoritarian Regimes","titleShort":"Authoritarian Regimes","instructors":[{"id":5095,"name":"George T.

First, through a variety of readings and discussions (including, perhaps, with the assigned scholars themselves), it aims to introduce students to the challenges of original scholarly research and expose them to the range of ways political scientists approach those challenges. Second, through a series of regular exercises and assignments, it seeks to stimulate critical thinking about fundamental questions of research design (crafting a question, performing a literature review, selecting appropriate methodological tools, evaluating data sources) and hone an array of practical skills--whether interpretive, historical, or quantitative--involved in political science research. Third, through ongoing, self-guided reading on students' individual topics as well as feedback from both the seminar leader and other seminar participants on their written work about that topic, it endeavors to guide students to frame a viable and meaningful research project. At the conclusion of the seminar, each student will submit a substantial and rigorous 10-12 page research proposal, with an annotated bibliography, for a roughly 35 page \"article-length\" thesis to be completed during Winter Study and the spring semester.

Rumi's spiritual wisdom is seen as transcending the confines of organized religion, with its divisive dogmas and restrictive rules. What is much less well-known is that Rumi was a devout Muslim mystic, a practitioner of the Islamic spiritual tradition of Sufism.\nThis course will take the poetry and teachings of Rumi as a lens to reflect on spirituality, both in a practical and introspective way, as well as a matter of historical and cultural analysis. We will read two types of translations of Rumi: those that adapt Rumi's work for a modern Western audience, and those that are more direct translations of Rumi's work in its original Islamic idiom. We will also do some broader readings to contextualize the medieval Sufi background that Rumi functioned within, as well as the contemporary scene of popular spirituality and self-help in the US. Through these comparative readings, we will consider the following: What does spirituality and self-cultivation mean to you personally? How does the experience and significance of spirituality change, from the context of traditional Sufism, to 21st century self-help and popular spirituality? What does this tell us about broader trends and conditions in our society?

From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in what they called the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey), the place of Christ's life, death, and believed resurrection. Large numbers of pilgrims even made the long journey to the Holy Land, and especially to Jerusalem, to visit a range of sacred sites related to Christ and his saints. When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century -- and even before this time -- Europeans sought to recreate many of them at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser \"crusades.\" Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. Through all of these centuries, moreover, the Christian, Greek-speaking empire of Byzantium, focused on its great capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), interacted in myriad ways, both friendly and hostile, with the Latin-speaking polities of Western Europe, focused at least symbolically on their ancient capital of Rome. Together, by way of open discussion, we will explore artistic production within each of these different cross-cultural contexts of East-West encounter. In the process, we will reflect on how art could function as a conduit for the exchange of ideas in the Middle Ages, and how it could be used both to negotiate and to intensify cultural difference.","enrolmentPreferences":"First- and second-year students, but open to all","crossListing":["ARAB 212","ARTH 212","REL 210"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022138","department":"REL","number":215,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1218,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Religion In Latinx Literature, Art \u0026 Film","titleShort":"Religion In Latinx Literature","instructors":[{"id":12797,"name":"Efrain Agosto"}],"meetings":[{"days":"W","start":"13:10","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In this course, students will read and write short essays about novels and/or memoirs (4-5 pages), critically analyze film and artwork in short papers (3-4 pages), and write a research paper (8-10 pages) that analyzes the nexus of Latinx religion and art, whether fiction, film, memoir, or the visual arts.

The imperative to keep a text, word, image, or concept in constant motion, in order to generate as many meanings and cross-meanings as possible, challenges us to transform the act of interpretation itself into a virtuosic craft or art that can engage the human imagination as diversely and powerfully as the creation of the works being interpreted. At the same time, emphasis on the dynamism between text and interpreter should dispel the notion that only expansive works have expansive meanings. If interpretation itself is an art, then even the shortest text can contain \"everything\" within it when it participates in that art. This course will engage students in a radical experiment in the art of interpretation. Through a deep encounter with a selection of miniature texts, ranging from ancient rabbinic proverbs and medieval fables to the modern parables and fragments of Franz Kafka, as well as folklore and jokelore from every period in Jewish history up to the present, we will develop an interpretive practice that combines analytic, critical, and creative principles in both written and oral contexts.

He is also arguably the most prominent and influential Muslim in the history of the United States. His story and legacy powerfully illustrate the complex intersections of Muslim identity, political resistance, and national belonging. From the early period of \"Black Muslim\" movements represented by Malcolm X, to the current \"War on Terror\" era, American Muslims have faced a complex intersection of exclusions and marginalization, in relation to national belonging, race, and religion. Taking Malcolm X as our point of departure, this course examines how American Muslims have navigated these multiple layers of marginalization. We will therefore consider how the broader socio-political contexts that Muslims are a part of shape their visions of Islam, and how they contest these competing visions among themselves. In so doing, we will examine the complex relation between religion, race, and politics in the United States.\nThroughout the course, we will be engaging with historical and anthropological material, autobiographies, documentaries, films, historical primary-source documents, music, and social media materials. The course fosters critical thinking about diversity by challenging assumptions of who Muslims are, what being American means, and what Islam is. It also focuses on the complex interaction of different dimensions of diversity, from religion to ideology, race, nationality, ethnicity, culture, gender, and language.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and concentrators in REL, AFR, and AMST","crossListing":["AAS 237","AFR 237","AMST 237","REL 237"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"016903","department":"REL","number":239,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1890,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"The Modern Middle East","titleShort":"The Modern Middle East","instructors":[{"id":2250,"name":"Magnús T.

Arab and Berber Jews' departure from their ancestral lands left a socioeconomic and cultural void that Maghrebi and Middle Eastern cultural production has finally started to address, albeit shyly.

Reading fiction, autobiographies, ethnographies, historiographical works, and anthropological texts alongside documentaries films, the students will understand how literature and film have become a locus in which amnesia about Arab/Berber Jews is actively contested by recreating a bygone world.

Both the role of religion in the imperialist endeavor and the solidarity movements that responded will occupy our time in this course, with special attention to key figures in both sides of such efforts. With some enhanced understanding of the intertwining of religion and politics in Puerto Rico, Cuba and their diasporic communities, participants in this class will also consider implications for other Caribbean nations, such as the Dominican Republic, as well as Latin American countries that have experienced US interventions and the creation of diasporic communities.","enrolmentPreferences":"LATS concentrators and Religion majors, and those with expressed interest in these fields","crossListing":["LATS 253","REL 292"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022062","department":"REL","number":295,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3298,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Foundations Of Confucian Thought","titleShort":"Confucian Thought","instructors":[{"id":1995,"name":"Christopher M.

These are some of the key questions that the school of thought that has come to be known as \"Confucianism\" addresses. As the dominant moral and political philosophy for thousands of years in much of East Asia, Confucianism has shaped our world, past and present, in innumerable ways.

His plays and poems have shaped the linguistic, philosophical, and artistic representation of human experience in ways that permeate every aspect of our lives. Shakespeare's capacious work and its central preoccupation with the essential questions of humanity have also inspired an extensive tradition of commentary, interpretation, and performance. In this regard, his work occupies a position similar to the one held by the collection of writings known in the Jewish tradition as \u003cI\u003eTorah\u003c/I\u003e. This term refers both to the set of books contained in the Hebrew Bible and to the rabbinic tradition that emerged from reading those books, which in turn has provided the core principles for over two millennia of Jewish interpretive practice. This course invites students to read Shakespeare as Torah by applying the essential features of that practice to his extraordinary work. Through a deep and sustained encounter with four plays in four different genres (\u003cI\u003eHamlet\u003c/I\u003e, \u003cI\u003eHenry IV\u003c/I\u003e, \u003cI\u003eTwelfth Night\u003c/I\u003e, and \u003cI\u003eThe Tempest\u003c/I\u003e), we will combine analytic, critical, and creative principles to make meaning in and out of these texts.

Commanding unprecedented resources and administering a population of 100 to 150 million at its zenith--much larger than any European empire in the early modern world--the Mughals established a centralized administration, with a vast complex of personnel, money, and information networks. Mughal emperors were also political and cultural innovators of global repute. Moreover, while the Mughal dynasty was brought to an end with British colonial rule over India in 1857, the Mughal administrative structures and cultural influences continued to have a lasting impact on the British and later Indian states that followed. Centered around the intersection of the themes of power, patronage of art and architecture and religion, this course will ask: What factors contributed to the durability of the Mughal Empire for three centuries? How did global trade and innovations in taxation contribute to its wealth and stability? How did this dynasty of Muslim monarchs rule over diverse, and largely non-Muslim populations? How did they combine Persian cultural elements with regional ones to establish an empire that was truly Indian in nature? How were the Mughals viewed in their contemporary world of gunpowder empires like the Safavids of Persia and the Ottomans of Turkey? Readings will include the best of the recent scholarship on this vastly influential empire and a rich collection of primary sources, including emperor's memoirs, accounts of European travelers, and racy biographies, which will allow students make their own analysis. They will also have the opportunity to interpret paintings (some of which are held in the WCMA collections) and architecture. They will also discuss how the Mughals are remembered in South Asian film and music.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors and potential History majors","crossListing":["GBST 312","HIST 312","REL 312","ASIA 312"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"010998","department":"REL","number":319,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3789,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Milton'S Paradise Lost","titleShort":"Milton'S Paradise Lost","instructors":[{"id":1985,"name":"Christian Thorne"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MR","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"One 6- to 8-page paper, one 10- to 12-page paper, informal weekly writing assignments, and active seminar participation","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"A 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam.

It's hard to shake the feeling that Milton is the fustiest of English poets--dull, pious, brilliant and all, and not someone you would read if you didn't have to. But then what are we to make of the following? The first piece that Milton wrote that was read widely throughout Europe was a boisterous defense of the English Revolution. Milton was most famous in his lifetime as the poet who went to bat for the Puritan insurgents--the poet who came right out and said that the king looked better without his head. Of all the major English poets, Milton is the revolutionary. So a course on Milton is by necessity a course on literature and revolution. We will read Paradise Lost, widely regarded as the greatest non-dramatic poem in English, and a few other books to help us prepare for that big one. Some questions: How did the mid-seventeenth century, probably the most tumultuous decades in the history of modern Britain, transform the culture of the English-speaking world? What is the relationship between literature and the state or between literature and radical politics? Is there a poetics of revolution?

From every corner we are told: \"To thine own self be true!\" This powerful moral ideal has arguably become an inescapable and hegemonic frame of U.S. cultural life in the 21st century (and more broadly middle-class life around the globe). The imperative of authentic self-realization -- to discover and become your \"true self,\" in opposition to mere conformity to social conventions and independent of external expectations -- is seen as essential if we are to live a healthy and fulfilling life, and to fully realize what it means to be human in the deepest sense.\nThis course will interrogate this ideal and imperative of personal authenticity from several angles. We will begin by examining some contemporary manifestations of this ethos. We will then explore the historical roots and evolution of the emphasis on authentic selfhood in the modern West, as well as comparable notions of sincerity, selfhood, interiority, and introspection in other (non-liberal, non-Christian) cultural contexts and religious traditions. We will also consider the ideal of authenticity in light of contemporary social theory, as well as engage a variety of ethical-political critiques of authenticity.\nThrough this, we will investigate a number of important questions: Is there such a thing as the \"true self\" that is autonomous and free of social influences and norms, and how does one discover this true self? What are the limits and social consequences of this aspiration towards authentic selfhood? What are the effects of the widespread commodification of authenticity, and how should we understand the relation between personal authenticity and the conditions of late-stage capitalism? Is the rhetoric of personal authenticity simply an expression of narcissistic individualism, or is there a higher moral value and ideal that it speaks to? Can community cohesion and shared collective purpose be sustained alongside the imperative of authenticity? How does the ideal of authentic selfhood interact with collective or socially-conferred identities (like race, heritage, or religion)? Is personal authenticity ultimately just a white secular value, or is it an available and achievable ideal for those who do not fit this hegemonic mold?","enrolmentPreferences":"Religion majors; Juniors and seniors","crossListing":["REL 320"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022120","department":"REL","number":325,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1906,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Faith And Profit In The Medieval Mediterranean","titleShort":"Faith Profit Med Mediterranean","instructors":[{"id":13527,"name":"Joel S.

Why is image-making so hotly contested in Islam? What is the history of figural depictions in this tradition? The seminar explores artworks made for Muslim patrons from the medieval period to the modern era, considering how paintings produced for Muslim audiences can be situated within the frameworks of \"Islamic art,\" a loaded historiographical term that has been questioned in recent times. The seminar also addresses some of the major problems that continue to haunt art scholarship in the field. For most of its history, the academic study of Islamic art has seldom considered contemporaneous literary voices that shed light on the motivations behind artworks. Furthermore, the historiography, deeply entrenched in its colonial and orientalist roots, has largely isolated images from their supporting texts--a curious oversight in light of the fact that painting in Muslim lands has historically been primarily an art of the book. These biases have affected the way museums have collected, displayed and interpreted paintings. For example, Western museums continue to place figural depictions made for books and albums in \"South Asian\" collections while textual manuscripts and calligraphic specimens made for the same Muslim audiences--even at times bound in the same albums--are categorized as \"Islamic art.\" What does this isolation of text from image imply about prevailing views of Islamic art? To better understand the cultural, historical and religious context surrounding artworks students will read primary literature ranging from autobiography to devotional poetry, often written by the very patrons and subjects of the paintings to be discussed.","enrolmentPreferences":"MA students, then advanced undergraduates","crossListing":["ARTH 521","REL 420"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012235","department":"REL","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1767,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Religion","titleShort":"Senior Thesis: Religion","instructors":[{"id":3019,"name":"Jeffrey I.

Known as the \"war to end (all) war(s),\" World War I set the stage for an entire century of military conflict and carnage. New technologies led to unprecedented violence in the trenches, killing and wounding as many as 41 million soldiers and civilians. Beyond the slaughter at the front, the Great War also led to the global influenza pandemic that claimed up to 50 million lives, and the Armenian genocide that presaged the later atrocities of the Holocaust. The war also led to massive political transformation, from the Irish Rebellion and Russian Revolution, to the collapse of the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires, and the redrawing of national borders across Europe and the Middle East. Even the end of the war with the Treaty of Versailles lay the groundwork for new animosities that would lead to the Second World War just two decades later. However, the First World War also inspired great social change, from the emergence of the United States as a global leader and the founding of the League of Nations, to growing discontent with colonial rule in Asia and Africa, and greater power for women whose wartime labor influenced the post-war passage of their right to vote in countries across Europe and North America. In our study of the Great War, we will examine texts and films that bear witness to the suffering and courage of soldiers and civilians, and consider the legacy of the war in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Readings to include memoirs and novels by Barbusse, Barker, Brittain, Cocteau, Graves, Hemingway, Jünger, Remarque, Wharton, Woolf; poetry by Apollinaire, Brooke, Mackintosh, McCrae, Owen, Sassoon; films by Attenborough, Boyd, Carion, Chaplin, Jeunet, Ozon, Renoir, Trumbo, Walsh, Weir; and archival materials on the roles of Williams students and faculty during the First World War. \u003cI\u003eReadings and Discussions in English.\u003c/I\u003e","enrolmentPreferences":"All are welcome, but if the course is overenrolled, preference will be given to Comparative Literature majors and French majors and certificate students; if the course is over-enrolled, students will submit a form online.","crossListing":["COMP 224","RLFR 225"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022417","department":"RLFR","number":234,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3157,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Francophone Oceania: The Other Side Of The Postcard","titleShort":"Francophone Oceania","instructors":[{"id":14439,"name":"Eric J.

This course is a comprehensive survey of the literature, modern history, and aesthetics that inform the field of contemporary Francophone Oceanian Studies. Major concepts in Indigenous Oceanian philosophy and genealogies of thought (from Ma'ohi, Kanak, and Ni-Vanuatu communities in particular), European imperialism and racial politics, gender and sexuality, maritime knowledges, the French nuclear agenda and climate fiction will be studied. Students will use multimedia formats and storytelling techniques to cross-examine narrative development, philosophy, and Oceanian history from a comparative perspective.

In Louisiana, Francophone activists have been fighting to preserve their unique dialect of French--or what Professor Barry Jean Ancelet calls \"the problem language\"--for decades. By promoting the education and use of French in the state, what else are they preserving? From historical, thematic, and literary perspectives, this course is designed to provide an answer to such questions through the examination of Francophone Louisiana from its foundation as a French colony to today. In this course, we rely on contemporary publications and media in French to get a broader picture of the current stakes in Francophone Louisiana. Topics will include sociolinguistics, race relations, creolization, activism, and Americanization. Primary sources include rituals, cartoons, films, memes, music, literature, and cuisine.

But in Verne's vision of modernity, technological sophistication gives way to intellectual stagnation and social indifference, in a world where poetry and literature have been abandoned in favor of bureaucratic efficiency, mechanized surveillance, and the merciless pursuit of profit. To contest or confirm this dystopic vision, we will examine a broad range of twentieth-century novels and their focus on adversity and modernity. In a century dominated by the devastation of two World Wars, the atrocities of colonial empire, and massive social and political transformation, the novel both documented and interrogated France's engagement with race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, colonialism and immigration. Within this historical context, we will discuss the role of the novel in confronting war and disease, challenging poverty and greed, and exposing urban isolation and cultural alienation in twentieth-century France. Readings to include novels by Colette, Genet, Camus, Duras, Ernaux, Guibert, Begag. Lectures to include discussions of Gide, Proust, Sartre, Beauvoir, Cixous, Foucault, Jelloun, Djébar.

We will then delve into the study of how deterritorialized peoples created their languages and cultures, distinct from the ones imposed by colonizing forces. As we journey from the past to the present, we will also explore how international events such as a worldwide pandemic, social justice, racism, and police brutality are currently affecting these islands.

The first-person narrative chronicling the life of a fictional figure bearing a close relationship to Proust himself spans several decades from the late 19th to the early 20th century, centering on French high society as it enters the modern world, shaped by historical events such as the Dreyfus Affair and the First World War. Proust's exploration of the consciousness of the protagonist, an aspiring writer, has led readers to see him as a philosopher of aesthetics, of the psyche, of time and memory, and of the nature of desire. His narrative ranges from meditations on such subjects to social satire to absorbing and sometimes soap opera-like plots exploring upward and downward social mobility and a wide array of sexual entanglements, straight and queer. Through his fluent prose, Proust renders the vicissitudes of desire, loss, and joy, of betrayal and emotional intransigence, and tests the power of memory and the imagination to recapture the past. Because of the length of \u003cI\u003eIn Search of Lost Time\u003c/I\u003e, the emphasis of the course will be more on reading (about 7 to 7½ hours per week) and less on writing (four or five 1½-page journal entries and a final paper of 8-10 pages) than the average 300-level course; and approximately one-third of the sequence will be bracketed as optional reading.","enrolmentPreferences":"English, French, and Comparative Literature majors","crossListing":["COMP 378","ENGL 378","RLFR 378"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022364","department":"RLFR","number":415,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3159,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Breaking The Silence: Women Voices, Empowerment And Equality In The Francophone World","titleShort":"Francophone Women'S Voices","instructors":[{"id":13534,"name":"Preea Leelah"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MW","start":"11:00","end":"12:15","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Three 3-4-page response papers, a final 10-page research paper, presentation and active participation.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Any 200-level RLFR course, or by permission of instructor","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"How have Francophone women challenged the historical and current effects of colonialism and gendered racism in France and the Francophone world?

This course considers works of literature and other cultural texts in which love and politics are explicitly intertwined: the authors, artists and activists we consider profess love for their followers and would-be converts, represent love as a (revolutionary) political force, contest the legitimacy of patriarchal heteronormativity, and sometimes all three. We will consider writings by 20th and 21st century political leaders whose speeches and other writings convey the melodrama of \u003cI\u003eradionovelas\u003c/I\u003e (Eva Perón) as well as the sacrificial love of the guerrillero (José Martí, Che Guevara) and the anarchist (Rafael Barrett). We may also consider the love professed by historical figures including Catholic missionaries (Antonio Ruiz de Rivera) and 19th century abolitionists (Juan Francisco Manzano, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda) and/or nation-builders (Mármol, Sarmiento). We may examine tensions around the domestication of love in writings in translation by Brazil's Clarice Lispector and the torment of eros in Elena Garro's political novel \u003cI\u003eMemories of the Future\u003c/I\u003e. We will likely read poems of grief and love for those murdered in the secret detention centers of the Southern Cone dictatorships (Raúl Zurita, Juan Gelman).

Absalom! by Faulkner, whose influence on Latin-American authors' techniques of representation has been decisive and profound.","enrolmentPreferences":"Spanish majors, Latina/o Studies concentrators","crossListing":["RLSP 319"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021915","department":"RLSP","number":405,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3135,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Racialized Bodies On Display","titleShort":"Racialized Bodies","instructors":[{"id":14437,"name":"Sahai Couso Diaz"}],"meetings":[{"days":"TF","start":"14:35","end":"15:50","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"In addition to active and informed class participation, requirements include one presentation, two short papers, and a final project.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Any 300-level RLSP course or permission of instructor","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Across the Americas, the bodies of contemporary Indigenous people were displayed next to bones, fossils, and ruins to separate them from their lands and natural resources; while the bodies and bones of enslaved people were collected, dissected, and displayed to support racist theories of stratification and discourses of difference. This course examines the persistent role that collections have played in the construction of pseudo-scientific racial knowledge in the Americas. It traces the display of Black and Indigenous bodies as objects in museums, literature, paintings, engravings, photographic albums, and other media, as well as contemporary interventions and critiques of the deceiving nature of scientific racism. We will study visual and material culture alongside fiction and non-fiction texts to explore how collections become a narrative device for a racialized representation of reality. One of the main questions of this course is how do images, literature, and objects shape our understanding of scientific ideas and culture? We will also engage in critique from an intersectional perspective to consider how media are shaped by logics of race, gender, and ability. This course gives students the tools to discuss the ethics of material and visual display as well as the general notion of archives as sources of historical preservation. We will explore chronicles, the work of eighteenth-century authors such as Lorenzo Boturini and Francisco Javier Clavigero, as well as casta paintings, Julio Popper's photographic album and Israel Castellanos' \u003cI\u003eLa delincuencia femenina\u003c/I\u003e, museum collections, and contemporary interventions and critiques such as Ana Mendieta's Glass on Body Imprints or the performance \u003cI\u003eThe Couple in the Cage\u003c/I\u003e by Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gomez Pena. We will also read a number of critical essays by leading scholars in the fields of decolonial theory and museum studies such as Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, J. Kehaulani Kauanui, Walter Mignolo, and Silvia Spitta, among others.","enrolmentPreferences":"Senior Spanish Majors.","crossListing":["RLSP 405"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012316","department":"RLSP","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1146,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Spanish","titleShort":"Senior Thesis: Spanish","instructors":[{"id":2301,"name":"Leyla Rouhi"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Spanish senior thesis; this is part of a full-year thesis (493-494).","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["RLSP 493"],"components":["Honors"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"012317","department":"RLSP","number":494,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3136,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Spanish","titleShort":"Senior Thesis: Spanish","instructors":[{"id":2301,"name":"Leyla Rouhi"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Spanish senior thesis; this is part of a full-year thesis (493-494).","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["RLSP 494"],"components":["Honors"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012318","department":"RLSP","number":497,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1147,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Spanish","titleShort":"Independent Study: Spanish","instructors":[{"id":2301,"name":"Leyla Rouhi"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Spanish independent study.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["RLSP 497"],"components":["Independent Study"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"012319","department":"RLSP","number":498,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3137,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Spanish","titleShort":"Independent Study: Spanish","instructors":[{"id":2301,"name":"Leyla Rouhi"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Spanish independent study.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["RLSP 498"],"components":["Independent Study"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012320","department":"RUSS","number":101,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1866,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Elementary Russian I","titleShort":"Elementary Russian I","instructors":[{"id":2117,"name":"Janneke van de Stadt"}],"meetings":[{"days":"MWF","start":"10:00","end":"10:50","facility":""},{"days":"TR","start":"09:55","end":"11:10","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":true,"div2":false,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"This Class Is Hyphenated With RUSS 102 And Meets Five Times A Week","classReqEval":"Active class participation, completion of all assignments, regular summative exercises, written and oral final exercises","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"Students registered for RUSS 101-102 are required to attend and to pass the sustaining program during the winter study period; credit granted only if both semesters (RUSS 101 and 102) are taken.","descriptionSearch":"An introduction to contemporary standard Russian, this course provides opportunities to acquire basic proficiency in all five language skills--listening comprehension, speaking, reading, writing, and culture--through immersion, intensive use of authentic materials, and a strong emphasis on the spoken word in all class activities.

Rather than prioritizing concern with Indigenous peoples emerging from the US, it attempts to demonstrate what Indigeneity has been in both the United States and Russia and what it is and means today. It asks the following questions: what is Indigeneity and who is Indigenous; how is Indigenous identity constructed and by whom; and what convergences and divergences exist in Indigeneity between the US and Russia or for that matter in other contexts? To help answer these questions, in this course we will grapples with Indigeneity as a social category and other social formations, especially ethnicity, nationality, and race. Topics include: Indigeneity and the State, Revitalization and Resurgence, Indigenous People and Nature Protection, and Hemispheric and Global Indigeneities.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors and certificate-seekers in Russian, then majors in Anthropology and Sociology, and then Global Studies concentrators","crossListing":["ANTH 217","GBST 219","RUSS 217"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"012342","department":"RUSS","number":306,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3835,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Tolstoy And The Meaning Of Life","titleShort":"Tolstoy","instructors":[{"id":2161,"name":"Julie A.

The Russian intelligentsia as a social class took shape among the educated raznochintsy and aristocratic proponents of western ideas who had been freed from obligatory state service. These conditions provided them with limited freedom and independence, and also gave them the opportunity to devote their time to culture, creation, and science. This state of affairs was favorable for the development of the distinguishing characteristic of the intelligentsia: critical thought, both in relation to authority and to oneself. In this course we will study the history, ethic and tradition of the intelligentsia from the times of the tsars until the present day. In particular, we will explore the following questions: what is the difference between being educated and belonging to the intelligentsia? How does the intelligentsia relate to the history and tradition of socialism? How is the intelligentsia connected with humanism? What is the fate of the intelligentsia in an industrial or totalitarian society? And what role does this tradition play today? In order to answer these questions, we will read authentic historical texts and scholarly literature, watch films and listen to lectures by the foremost specialists on the subject.

First described by philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham, the Panopticon is a physical structure that enables one observer to see all inhabitants without those inhabitants knowing when they are being observed. In \u003cI\u003eDiscipline and Punish\u003c/I\u003e, Michel Foucault famously expanded thinking on the Panopticon as a metaphor for the \"disciplinary\" power that lies at the heart of inequality in modern society. Since Bentham and Foucault's time, however, surveillance technologies have changed significantly. To what extent does the concept of the Panopticon give us purchase on today's surveillance societies? How does watching people with new digital and algorithmic surveillance technologies shape the exercise of power and, in turn, (re)produce forms of inequality? Can privacy, convenience, and safety ever be truly balanced? Topics include: the historical origins and expansion of surveillance in modern societies, policing and state surveillance, and social media surveillance.","enrolmentPreferences":"Anthropology and Sociology majors","crossListing":["SOC 228","STS 229"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020005","department":"SOC","number":241,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3695,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Meritocracy","titleShort":"Meritocracy","instructors":[{"id":1820,"name":"Darel E.

The first part of the course examines the historical origins of capitalism and leading theories about what capitalism is and how it stratifies the world into racialized social classes. A central theme in part one will be how capitalist labor relations shape meaning and subjectivity, particularly the experience of dignity. In part two, we examine recent and emerging trends in capitalist labor, such as the death of the career, the rise of the \"gig\" economy, platform capitalism, and even the seemingly inevitable end of work itself as entire occupations become automated by machine learning. A key question will be how these transformations exacerbate and/or alleviate longstanding inequalities from capitalism's 19th century past. The course concludes by asking students to imagine a better vision for work in the next century. Should we continue to work at all?

And how do these encounters with difference impact current events, such as the war Russia is currently waging on Ukraine, or the persistent tensions between East and West Germans? This tutorial will examine new dilemmas through ethnographic studies and documentary films that aim to capture in real time the process of articulating and grappling with newly discovered divides. We will focus especially closely on Russia, but will also read studies on East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, and Ukraine. This course fulfills the DPE requirement by exploring comparatively the ways in which people in different countries made sense of the social, cultural and political heterogeneity of the postsocialist condition.","enrolmentPreferences":"Anthropology, Sociology, and Russian majors","crossListing":["GBST 348","RUSS 348","SOC 348"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020446","department":"SOC","number":362,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3655,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Stories We Tell","titleShort":"Stories We Tell","instructors":[{"id":8359,"name":"Christina E.

Indeed, sociologists have argued that social life is itself \"storied\"--that we locate ourselves within familiar narrative structures, using them to \"construct\" identities and \"tell\" our lives. Stories, in this view, are not only the stuff of literature, but also the very fabric of social life: the foundation for individual and collective identities. This course grapples with the role of stories and storytelling in modern social life. What role do stories play in constituting personal identity? What cultural templates structure the stories we tell? Why are memoirs so popular, and how can we explain the more recent resurgence of interest in oral forms of storytelling? What role does storytelling play in politics and social movements? Specific topics will include confessional culture, podcasts, memoir, politics, and social change. Along the way, we will pay explicit attention to medium, and consider how sociologists might learn from journalists, documentarians, and memoirists to convey stories from their own research.","enrolmentPreferences":"If overenrolled, students will be asked to submit a short statement of interest","crossListing":["SOC 362","COMP 362"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022097","department":"SOC","number":380,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3657,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Who Cares?","titleShort":"Who Cares?","instructors":[{"id":8359,"name":"Christina E.

We often assume that care arises spontaneously and organically. Yet both feelings of care and acts of care always take shape in social contexts. In this course, we will uncover and critically interrogate the norms surrounding caring, caregiving, and care-receiving in our own communities. What social factors influence our willingness to offer care, and to accept it from others? Why is caregiving so heavily gendered and racialized? Is care inevitably corrupted by capitalism? Specific topics will include domestic work and reproductive labor; child welfare and foster care; therapy and mental health care; the discourse of self-care; and social movements that center around enacting care.

We'll emphasize applications over theory and analyze real data sets throughout the course.","enrolmentPreferences":"Prospective Statistics majors and more senior students","crossListing":["STAT 202"],"components":["Lecture"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022035","department":"STAT","number":297,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1510,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Statistics","titleShort":"Independent Study: Statistics","instructors":[{"id":1982,"name":"Bernhard Klingenberg"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":false,"div3":true,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Decided by the department","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Permission of department","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Directed 200-level independent study in Statistics.","enrolmentPreferences":"Decided by the department","crossListing":["STAT 297"],"components":["Independent Study"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022034","department":"STAT","number":298,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3522,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Statistics","titleShort":"Independent Study: Statistics","instructors":[{"id":1982,"name":"Bernhard Klingenberg"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":false,"div3":true,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Decided by the department","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"Permission of department","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Directed 200-level independent study in Statistics.","enrolmentPreferences":"Decided by the department","crossListing":["STAT 298"],"components":["Independent Study"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"021669","department":"STAT","number":335,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3523,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Lecture","titleLong":"Introduction To Biostatistics And Epidemiology","titleShort":"Intro Biostat \u0026 Epidemiology","instructors":[{"id":10245,"name":"Anna M.

Pairing these with works in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS), we will explore concepts like the Native \"slipstream,\" eco-erotics, post-post-apocalyptic stress, Native pessimism, biomedical speculative horror, and what it would be like to fly a canoe through outer space.","enrolmentPreferences":"First and second year students, American Studies majors, Science and Technology Studies concentrators","crossListing":["AMST 142","STS 142"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"022302","department":"STS","number":145,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3587,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Black Mathematics: The Power Of Revolutionary Numbers","titleShort":"Black Mathematics/Numbers","instructors":[{"id":12787,"name":"Keston K.

Numbers can be used to illuminate, obscure or oppress. Numbers are not only symbols in the strictest sense, but are powerful representations that have considerable impact on institutions, policy, the real world and our lives. Data are said to be the \"Black gold\" of the 21st century. By use of human, economic, political and social indicators and metrics Western scientists, statisticians, governments and powerful actors have promoted liberalism, militarism and capitalism, which often dehumanized the racialized 'Other'. Various techniques in social sciences like forecasting, statistics, quantification, predicting, modeling all rely heavily on numbers or their manipulation/interpretation. But what social and economic goals and who do statistics serve? What ideologies underpin these numbers about Black people/communities? What is the significance of numbers to Black life? To what purpose have numbers been put in the furtherance of Black liberation? This course addresses these questions and the different uses to which numbers have been put by Black revolutionaries and communities. Black activists, scholars and communities have questioned how statistics are formulated, used and their Eurocentric basis as well as their limited ability to accurately reflect the Black world. We delve an alternative Black philosophy, specifically how Black people have historically used/defied/circumvented the numbers game. We will study and historically trace the invention of statistics, and how Black people, organizations and communities have utilized numbers to resist oppression, shape movements and direct emancipatory efforts. From Ida B Wells, to W. E. B. du Bois, Claudia Jones and Eric Williams, using numbers differently, has pushed back against oppression, reinterpreted history and spurred social and political change.","enrolmentPreferences":"If over-enrolled, preference to AFR majors/concentrators.","crossListing":["AFR 145","STS 145"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021938","department":"STS","number":226,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1342,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"The Art Of Natural History","titleShort":"Art Of Natural History","instructors":[{"id":1708,"name":"Catherine N.

Drawing on the works of biologists, philosophers, and feminist science and technology studies scholars, this seminar will examine our relationships with animals and help clarify our responsibilities to them. We will ask: What are the social and environmental consequences of consuming animals? Should humans swim with dolphins, feed manatees, use gene-editing to create species that can survive climate change? Should moral standing depend upon the ability to communicate or the ability to experience emotions like grief and joy? What can animal models tell us about human health and society, and when is animal otherness too large a gap to bridge?

From the scientific fantasy of bombproofing and \"safety in space,\" to the fears of both racial and radioactive contamination that drove the creation of the American suburbs, the affective and material dimensions of nuclear weaponry have, from the beginning, been entangled with race. Drawing on the critical and analytical toolkits of American Studies and media archaeology, students will dig beneath the surface of received narratives about the arms race, the space race, and race itself. Students will uncover generative connections between mineral extraction, the oppression of Indigenous populations, the destructive legacies of \"urban renewal,\" and the figure of the \"typical American family\" huddled in their backyard bunker.

How do plays and performances across global networks engage with different models of feminism: liberal, radical, materialist, and intersectional? Why has feminism mattered to theatre-makers of the past? Should it still matter now? If so, what forms might future feminist theatres take? In this tutorial course, students will work in pairs to examine the social and political relation of feminism to the art and practice of theatre. Taking a global and comparative perspective on the subject, we will focus on the intersectionalities of gender, race, class, ethnicity, nationality, and sexual identity in the production of feminist-driven theatrical practices. Artists, companies, and movements to be considered may include: Spiderwoman Theatre, Adrienne Kennedy, Caryl Churchill, Sphinx Theatre Company, Ntozake Shange, Griselda Gambaro, Manjula Padmanabhan, Cherríe Moraga, Lisa Kron, Arethusa Speaks, Maya Krishna Rao, Tracie Chima Utoh-Ezeajugh, Alexis Scheer, Tori Sampson, Clare Barron, and others.

In nearly all of our academic pursuits, the point of analysis is to find meaning, to explain intricate or confusing phenomena, to provide clarity from complexity. What happens when we can't do this, indeed, when the objects of our analytical attention seem willfully designed to thwart the attempt? Such is the challenge of \"understanding\" the traditions of the absurd. In this tutorial course, we will engage this challenge within the realm of Western theatre and performance from 1900 to the present. Beginning with selected readings from writers who have engaged the absurd in theoretical fashion (Albert Camus, Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Esslin), the course will move swiftly to original artworks for contemplation and analysis. Some questions we will grapple with include: How do we, can we, should we respond to art that specifically defies meaning? Can art that seems pointless have a point? Playwrights will range from canonical (Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco) to more obscure but equally engaging (as well as baffling) artists (Peter Handke, Slavomir Mrocek). We will follow standard practice in tutorial pairs, as each week one student will prepare original analysis of the assigned reading, and the other will craft a response to prompt an hour-long discussion.

Although Asian theatres have been studied systematically in the West for at least a century, the West has never truly left its \"othering\" look at them. Yet, what is \"different\" for the West is bedrock for Asian cultures. Theatre, one of the most important and dynamic forms of cultural production and communication, has actively involved all strata of Asian societies for a millennium. How to explain theatre's continued presence and relevance for Asian nations? What do the traditions of Kun, Noh, and Talchum reveal about the cultures and communities in which they were created? This course seeks to understand from the Asian perspective, rather than \"exoticize\" and \"other,\" musical and dance theatres from China, Japan, and Korea. Examining the evolving presentations of signature dramas dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, we will act out Asian theatres in the following ways: (1) by reading the original plays in translation in tandem with their contemporary and intercultural reproductions, we will explore how Asian theatres fare in the era of globalization within and beyond national borders; (2) by revealing the \"technologies\" of writing, reading, acting, and staging these plays in different cultural milieus, we will consider what kinds of language and rhetoric, forms of music and movement, as well as visual components are deployed to convey evolving messages; (3) by considering key performances held outside of the proscenium stage, we will gain exposure to alternative theatrical spaces in Asian and diasporic communities that reform performing conventions, reconfigure staging environments, and renegotiate cultural values. In this manner, we will together gain an appreciation for the aesthetic devices, thematic concerns, and production politics of East Asian theatres and their global reproductions. Class materials include drama, production videos, and invited zoom sessions with Asian theatre practitioners and directors who live in the U.S. and other diasporic communities.

Practicing the skills of a theatre historian, students will engage with the archives and repertoires of global theatre and performance, learning how to access, research, interpret, and gain deeper understandings of the artistic past. Examining how contemporary artists have engaged with (adapted, appropriated, recycled, or re-appropriated) historical sources and materials, students will themselves work towards the creation, development, and, if they like, performance of their own artistic approach to the historical archive and repertoire. While attending to theatre's formal aspects, we will at the same time focus on the relationship of performance to politics and society, as well as to the enduring legacies of empire, state power, colonialism, and private capital in which it is historically embedded and by which it has been shaped.

For example, how did musician Sidney Bechet's migration from New Orleans to Chicago to London influence the early jazz era? How did Katherine Dunham's dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem? What drew actor/singer Paul Robeson to Russia, and why did the U.S. revoke his passport in response to his speeches abroad? These questions will lead students to investigate multiple migrations in the African diasporic experience and aid our exploration of the reasons for migration throughout history and geography.

We will then examine how a series of organizations (from grassroots campaigns to multinational initiatives) utilize the performing arts in response to those issues.\nAmong the issues we will discuss at length are:\n-How do performers and organizations navigate the interplay between showcasing the performance talents of individuals and groups and foregrounding an issue or cause? More broadly, what dilemmas emerge as social and aesthetic imperatives intermingle?\n-What are the dynamics between people acting on a local level within their communities and their various international partnerships and audiences?\n-How can government or NGO sponsorship help and/or hinder systemic change?\nBy the end of the semester, students will be equipped with conceptual frameworks and critical vocabularies that can help them ascertain the functions of performance within larger organizations and in service to complex societal issues. Throughout the course, we will watch and listen to a variety of performances from traditional genres to hip-hop, however this class is less about learning to perform or analyze any particular genre than it is about thinking through how performance is used as a vehicle for social change.\nCase studies will include youth outreach and uplift in Tanzania through the United African Alliance, campaigns to promote girls' education in Benin and Zimbabwe, community-wide decolonizing initiatives through the Yole!Africa Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the cultural reclamation of a mining town in Suriname through the arts organization, Stichting Kibii.","enrolmentPreferences":"If the course exceeds the maximum enrollment, selection will be made based on students explanations for why they want to take the class.","crossListing":["DANC 323","MUS 323","THEA 321"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"021081","department":"THEA","number":336,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1650,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Boucicault To McDonagh: Irish Theatre, 1870 To The Present","titleShort":"Irish Theatre Since 1870","instructors":[{"id":2466,"name":"James L.

Using the literary techniques of social realism, the novel chronicles the life of a young rural woman from 1961 to 2001. Spring Grass, the protagonist of the novel, was born in a rural village to a mother who preferred sons over daughters. At a young age, Spring Grass was deprived of the opportunity to attend school. Against all odds, she managed to marry for love, venture into the city, and become an enterprising migrant worker. This novel not only reflects the struggles of women in contemporary China but also captures the economic transformation of modern China since 1978 when the Reform and Open-Door Policy (\u003cI\u003egaige kaifang\u003c/I\u003e) was initiated. The novel was adapted into a television drama series and became an instant hit in 2008. This course takes an interdisciplinary, cultural studies and humanistic approach to studying a literary text, using literature as a means to help students better understand social and cultural issues. Through close readings of the novel, the eponymous TV drama series, documentaries, and films depicting rural life and women's roles in China, as well as in-depth discussions of both primary and secondary sources that deal with the cultural, historical, and socioeconomic background of the unfolding story of Spring Grass, this course aims to provide a window for students to examine the issues of inequality in the Chinese village and society at large. Why would mothers be harsh to their own daughters and bar girls' right to education? Why would young people leave their village and migrate to the city? Why would migrant workers leave their children behind in the village? Why would economic developments in China exacerbate the problem of gender inequality in society? Why would the ideology and cultural logic behind Mao Zedong's proclamation \"women can hold up half of the sky\" add more burden to women rather than truly liberate them? Why would city people discriminate against country folks? After taking this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the issues related to gender inequality (\u003cI\u003enannü bu pingdeng\u003c/I\u003e) and the urban/rural-gap (\u003cI\u003echengxiang chabie\u003c/I\u003e) in China.

Often described as intra-racial racism, colorism within the Black American context is part of the colonial legacy of institutionalized slavery where the vestiges of white supremacy have created color castes among Blacks that still, to this day, have serious consequences for those on the darkest end of the color spectrum. The impact of this practice is far-reaching, influencing everything from romantic partnering, economic and educational attainment, and perceptions of beauty, attractiveness, and criminality. Although the vast majority of colorism scholarship is empirically based, there is much that we can glean from a literary investigation of this practice by analyzing the works of renowned writer, theorist, and folklorist Toni Morrison. Her work is particularly useful in examining issues of skin color, as this topic has been persistent yet underexplored in Morrison's writings. Employing the methods of literary and rhetorical criticism, this tutorial will investigate five Morrison novels, \u003cI\u003eThe Bluest Eye\u003c/I\u003e (1970), \u003cI\u003eSula\u003c/I\u003e (1973), \u003cI\u003eSong of Solomon\u003c/I\u003e (1977), \u003cI\u003eLove\u003c/I\u003e (2003) and \u003cI\u003eGod Help the Child\u003c/I\u003e (2015), and some of her non-fiction writings. In our discussions of each text, we will examine the problem of the \"color complex\" at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class and sexual violence, and how the characters manage these overlapping issues. We will bring the novels into conversation with social science articles on the practices of colorism in daily life. Because the tutorial blends different kinds of investigations into colorism, it will equip first year students with tools to critically engage and interrogate fictional literature; help them identify the real and nuanced ways that color discrimination affects Black communities; and consider how Morrison, one of our foremost writers, bridges literary creativity with ethnographic observation.","enrolmentPreferences":"This course is specifically for first-year students and they will receive preference in this class","crossListing":["AFR 205","WGSS 207"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022307","department":"WGSS","number":225,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1641,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Buddhism, Social Change, \u0026 Reproductive Justice In The Anthropocene","titleShort":"Buddhism \u0026 Social Change","instructors":[{"id":2586,"name":"Kim Gutschow"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Attendance, writing weekly essays or written feedback.

What kinds of violations and deprivations can be recognized as harms in need of redress? Who gets to make these judgments, and according to what rules? While our examples will be drawn mainly from family law, the regulation of sex/reproduction, and workplace discrimination, the main task of this course will be to deepen our understanding of how the subject of law is constituted.

Teetering between legal and ethical discourse, the Shari'a moves between what we normally consider law as well as ethics and etiquette.\nThe course will explore four key aspects of the law: its historical development, its ethical and legal content, the law in practice, and the transformation of Islamic law through colonialism and into the contemporary. Specific areas we will cover include: ritual piety, family and personal status law, criminal law, and dietary rules.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors","crossListing":["ARAB 243","HIST 302","REL 243","WGSS 243"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"019977","department":"WGSS","number":244,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1789,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Actually Existing Alternative Economies","titleShort":"Alternative Economies","instructors":[{"id":2166,"name":"Kiaran Honderich"}],"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Six papers of 5-7 pages, six written responses to partner's papers, participation in tutorial discussion","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"None","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Capitalism has a way of constricting our imaginations so that we come to believe the only possible form of economic institution is one based on profit seeking, competition and individualism. However movements in countries including Brazil, France, Canada and Spain--and now parts of the U.S.--are demonstrating otherwise. Theorists, practitioners and social activists are adopting labels including 'Solidarity Economy' and 'New Economy' to group together economic activities based on ideals of human provisioning, social justice and environmental sustainability. They point out that many of these activities are already taking place and are often crucial to our lives, but are rendered invisible by economic theory. In the words of Brazilian popular educator and economist Marcos Arruda, 'a solidarity economy does not arise from thinkers or ideas; it is the outcome of the concrete historical struggle of the human being to live and to develop him/herself as an individual and a collective.'  Feminist geographers Julie Graham and Katherine Gibson developed practices of 'mapping' local economies with communities in Australia and Western Massachusetts in ways that bring to light the invisible resources and practices of provisioning and solidarity, and challenge what they describe, drawing on the work of feminist theorist Sharon Marcus, as a 'script' of local helplessness to resist the 'rape' of their economies by the forces of global capitalism. Do these proposed discursive practices actually present realistic possibilities for producing sustained economic change? In this tutorial we will learn and debate about some of the activities being named and built under the label of solidarity economy, such as the networks of worker-owned cooperatives in Mondragon, Spain, the growth of local currencies and time exchanges, fair trade organizations and different ways of organizing care work. We will look at some of the history and debates around worker-owned cooperatives, ranging from Victorian England through African-American experiences throughout the 20th century and examples in post-Independence Africa, to the recent establishment of Cooperation Jackson in Jackson, Mississippi. The ILO has argued that co-ops are a particularly appropriate form to African development. Is this plausible, and what role might they play in AIDS-affected communities? Why has the recent U.S. growth of the solidarity economy been so concentrated in communities of color, and how is it gendered? We will visit some examples in New York or Boston.","enrolmentPreferences":"Open to sophomores and above","crossListing":["WGSS 244"],"components":["Tutorial"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"018332","department":"WGSS","number":250,"section":"T1","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1647,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Tutorial","titleLong":"Feminist Theatres: A Global Perspective","titleShort":"Global Feminist Theatres","instructors":[{"id":2022,"name":"Amy S.

In recent history, people marked as \"disabled\" have been subject to medical scrutiny, labeled deficient or defective, and often barred from full participation in society. And yet, what counts as \"disability\"--and who counts as disabled--varies greatly depending on cultural and historical context. Arguably, disability has more to do with social conditions than with any innate characteristics of disabled people themselves.\nThis class introduces disability studies, situating disability within its historical, political, and cultural contexts. As a GWSS course, we'll center queer and feminist perspectives; this class also emphasizes recent work. Echoing arguments in gender and sexuality studies, scholars have insisted that disability is not a natural or biological fact, but a socially constructed category. As such, scholars and activists have challenged medical models that conceptualize disability as an individual defect in need of elimination. They have also questioned the idea that disability is simply a minority identity -- to the contrary, disability is a condition that most humans will experience at some point in our lives.\nThis class frames \"disability\" broadly--encompassing not just conditions of physical impairment, but a wide range of bodily, sensory, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral differences and capacities. This class also centers how disability is produced intersectionally through regimes like race, capitalism, and empire. Topics include: theories of embodiment, eugenics, institutionalization and incarceration, neurodivergence, mad studies, the politics of health, storytelling and narrative, disability justice activism, neoliberalism, biopolitics, and crip theory. Along with scholarly writings, we'll consider activist texts, popular press, fiction, memoir, and a variety of other media.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference to majors, 3rd and 4th year students.","crossListing":["AMST 369","WGSS 332"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"011019","department":"WGSS","number":333,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1987,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"The Nineteenth-Century British Novel","titleShort":"19th Century British Novel","instructors":[{"id":1951,"name":"Alison A.

Shaking off its early disrepute, and taking advantage of growing literacy and innovations in production and distribution, it achieved in this period an unrivalled synthesis of mass appeal and aesthetic and social ambition. Its representational aspirations were breathtaking: attempting to comprehend in its pages the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as to delineate in finest detail the texture of individual lives and minds. In an age obsessed with the social, it engaged directly with the most compelling issues of the day, including industrialization and the gap between rich and poor, the role of women, nationalism and imperialism, and more broadly, the very nature of historical change itself. But it did so, for the most part, by telling fine-grained stories of ordinary men and women, people trying to make a living, worrying about their families and their neighbors, facing illness and death, and falling in--and sometimes out of--love. Since so many of these stories remain highly accessible works of popular culture, we will work hard to focus on what is strange and specific about the fiction of the nineteenth century, while also recognizing the roots of much that is modern in our own culture. We will also take seriously their social ambitions, looking especially at the ways they formulate, promote, and contest their readers' understanding of themselves as subjects and agents of an ongoing social history.

We will focus on these questions, as well as deploy various media examples (podcasts, social media, film, television and music) alongside scholarly texts to explore topics impacting the Latina/o/x communities such as the relationship between the relationship between immigration and disability, intergenerational trauma and migration, the gendered archetype of the Latina \"Loca,\" disability in academia, the politics of self-care amongst Latinas/xs in the neoliberal context, and the very legal, cultural, and social category of \"disabled\" itself within dominant society as well as in Latina/o/x communities.","enrolmentPreferences":"Preference given to LATS concentrators, AMST majors and WGSS majors by seniority.","crossListing":["LATS 344","WGSS 361","AMST 361"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"020280","department":"WGSS","number":371,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3628,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Unavailable","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Campus And Community Health In Disruptive Times","titleShort":"Campus Health","instructors":[{"id":2586,"name":"Kim Gutschow"}],"meetings":[{"days":"M","start":"19:00","end":"21:40","facility":""}],"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":true,"qfr":false,"wac":true,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"Weekly attendance, 3 written fieldnotes (3000 words), weekly writing \u0026 fieldwork exercises in class and out of class, a final presentation that includes data visualizations and analysis of research findings.","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"A course in Anthropology, Sociology, STS or in DIV II is strongly recommended","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"We study and seek \"campuses where students feel enabled to develop their life projects, building a sense of self-efficacy and respecting others, in community spaces that work to diminish rather than augment power asymmetries.\" --\u003cI\u003eSexual Citizens\u003c/I\u003e (Hirsch and Khan, 2020).

Every week, we collaborate with and share our research with our participants and peers both inside and outside class through a variety of innovative exercises. We attend to the parallel roles of narrative and listening in both medicine and ethnography, as we contrast the discourse of providers \u0026 patients along with researchers \u0026 participants. We aim to understand the strengths and limits of ethnographic inquiry while privileging marginalized voices and attending to power and identity within our participatory research framework. We recognize that our campus health projects are always already shaped by power and privilege, as we examine the ways that daily life, individual practices, and collective institutions shape health on and off campus. Our ethnographic case studies explore how systemic inequalities of wealth, race, gender, sex, ethnicity, and citizenship shape landscapes of pediatric care, mental health, maternity care, and campus sexual assault in the US and elsewhere. We consider how lived practices shape health access \u0026 outcomes as well as well-being in our communities and on our campus.","enrolmentPreferences":"Majors in Anthropology, Sociology, WGSS; Concentrators in PH, STS, ASIA, ENVI","crossListing":["WGSS 371","ANTH 371","STS 370"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"022402","department":"WGSS","number":391,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1852,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Unavailable, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Seminar","titleLong":"Contemporary North American Queer Literatures And Theories","titleShort":"Queer Literatures And Theories","instructors":[{"id":2223,"name":"Kathryn R.

While these are important, the voices of the people leaving their home countries and coming to the United States can be lost or buried. During the 1970s, the emerging subfield of social history asserted the need to craft histories that took into consideration the everyday lives of everyday people. Oral history emerged a key tool in capturing the personal stories too often missed in historical archives. At the same time, Puerto Rican Studies, Chicano Studies, and later, Latinx Studies emerged to tell the histories of groups too often omitted from or misrepresented in the scholarship. These fields relied on traditions of testimonios or storytelling. This course focuses on Latinx oral histories, autobiographies, memoirs, testimonios, and other first-person narratives to explore how people are impacted by and experience those broad historical contexts, as well as how the decisions they make and the actions they take shape those broad historical contexts. As Latinx Studies is a field that has been at the forefront of exploring intersectionality, we also analyze how attention to first person narratives and lived experiences reveal the complexities of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, as well as other visible and invisible markers of difference. Examining first person narratives in the context of specific Latinx groups in particular historical, geographical, and social contexts, we interrogate the methodological and interpretive challenges of working with oral histories and other first-person primary sources. Course topics include the gendered dimensions of migration, geopolitics and stories of exile, and the connections between lived experiences and political activism, particularly the feminist activism of the late 1960s and 1970s-- all while students develop and share their own research topics.","enrolmentPreferences":"History majors, WGSS majors, and Latina/o Studies concentrators, seniors","crossListing":["HIST 470","LATS 470","WGSS 470"],"components":["Seminar"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012537","department":"WGSS","number":493,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1800,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Women'S \u0026 Gender Studies","titleShort":"Sr Thesis:Women/Gender Studies","instructors":null,"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies senior thesis.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["WGSS 493"],"components":["Honors"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"012538","department":"WGSS","number":494,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3738,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course","classType":"Honors","titleLong":"Senior Thesis: Women'S \u0026 Gender Studies","titleShort":"Sr Thesis:Women/Gender Studies","instructors":null,"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":false,"fifthCourse":false},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies senior thesis.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["WGSS 494"],"components":["Honors"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Fall","courseID":"012539","department":"WGSS","number":497,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":1802,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Women'S \u0026 Gender Studies","titleShort":"Ind Study:Women/Gender Studies","instructors":null,"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies independent study.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["WGSS 497"],"components":["Independent Study"]},{"year":2024,"semester":"Spring","courseID":"012540","department":"WGSS","number":498,"section":"01","sectionType":"in-person","peoplesoftNumber":3739,"consent":"N","gradingBasisDesc":"Pass/Fail Available, Fifth Course Available","classType":"Independent Study","titleLong":"Independent Study: Women'S \u0026 Gender Studies","titleShort":"Ind Study:Women/Gender Studies","instructors":null,"meetings":null,"courseAttributes":{"div1":false,"div2":true,"div3":false,"dpe":false,"qfr":false,"wac":false,"passFail":true,"fifthCourse":true},"classFormat":"","classReqEval":"","extraInfo":"","prereqs":"","departmentNotes":"","descriptionSearch":"Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies independent study.","enrolmentPreferences":"","crossListing":["WGSS 498"],"components":["Independent Study"]}],"updateTime":"Thursday, 27-Apr-23 03:00:17 EDT"}
