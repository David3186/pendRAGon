Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas of research investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range topics that are of interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make transmission of information over the Internet possible; the design of revolutionary new computer languages that simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of machine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex for humans to analyze; algorithms that can solve problems that were previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of machine architectures and specific hardware aimed at making computing fast. \n",

      "Computers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as diverse as education, science, business, and the arts. Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas of research investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range topics that are of interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make transmission of information over the Internet possible; the design of revolutionary new computer languages that simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of machine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex for humans to analyze; algorithms that can solve problems that were previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of machine architectures and specific hardware aimed at making computing fast.\n",

In this lab-intensive experience for the Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics computational analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform each other, as students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics contribute their own expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key into human disease. In this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family of proteins, which a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will integrate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, and phylogenetics to reconstruct the evolution of gene families by focusing on the gene duplication events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through-put approaches to genes involved in the inflammatory and MAPK signal transduction pathways in human colon cancer cell lines, students will uncover regulatory mechanisms that are aberrantly altered by siRNA knockdown of putative regulatory components. This functional genomic strategy will be coupled independent projects using phosphorylation-state specific antisera to test our hypotheses. Proteomic analysis will introduce the students to de structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-mining approaches and Bayesian modeling of protein network dynamics in single Flow cytometry and mass spectrometry may also be used to study networks of interacting proteins in colon tumor cells.\n",

Our goal is to talk about why these efficient algorithms make seemingly difficult problems solvable in practice. The second topic is applications: we will discuss how to implement algorithms in an efficient way that takes advantage of modern hardware. Specific topics covered will include blocking, loop unrolling, pipelining, as well as strategies for performance analysis. Projects and assessments will include both basic theoretical aspects (understanding why the algorithms we discuss actually work), and practical aspects (implementing the algorithms we discuss to solve important problems, and optimizing the code so it runs as quickly as possible).\n",

Students will learn to act as effective product managers, achieving alignment between business, technology, and UI/UX design. Such alignment is crucial given that technology projects often fail not because of the quality of technical engineering but due to these three areas. Google Glass failed to account for its price tag, fashion, and the privacy panic. The initial Obamacare website failed to address management issues and predict the volume of website visitors. Flexcube failed to update and incorporate users into the design of their product, resulting in a $500 M UX mistake for Citi bank.

Jannen, Assistant Professor of Computer Science\\n\\nKatie A. Keith, Assistant Professor of Computer Science\\n\\nSamuel McCauley, Assistant Professor of Computer Science; on leave 2022-2023\\n\\nKelly A. Shaw, Professor of Computer Science\\n\\nShikha Singh, Assistant Professor of Computer Science; on leave 2022-2023\\n\\nAaron M. Williams, Associate Professor of Computer Science; on leave Spring 2023\\n\\nComputers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as diverse as education, science,\\n\\nbusiness, and the arts. Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of\\n\\ncomputer science. A sample of the areas of research investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range of\\n\\ntopics that are of interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated graphic images in\\n\\nthe arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make transmission of information over the Internet possible;\\n\\nthe design of revolutionary new computer languages that simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of\\n\\nmachine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex for humans to analyze; algorithms that\\n\\ncan solve problems that were previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the\\n\\ninvestigation of machine architectures and specific hardware aimed at making computing fast.\\n\\nThe department recognizes that students’ interests in computer science will vary widely. The department attempts to meet these varying interests\\n\\nthrough: (1) the major; (2) a selection of courses intended for those who are interested primarily in an introduction to computer science; (3)\\n\\nrecommended course sequences for the non-major who wants a more extensive introduction to computer science in general or who seeks to develop\\n\\nsome specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline.\\n\\nMAJOR\\n\\nThe goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the conceptual organization of computers and\\n\\ncomplex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and\\n\\ntheoretical ideas underlying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding computer science. The\\n\\nmore advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer architecture,\\n\\nnetworks, compiler design, human computer interaction, distributed systems, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work provide\\n\\nopportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.\\n\\nThe major in Computer Science equips students to pursue a wide variety of career opportunities. It can be used as preparation for a career in\\n\\ncomputing, for graduate school, or to provide important background and techniques for the student whose future career will extend outside of\\n\\ncomputer science.\\n\\nMAJOR REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nRequired Courses in Computer Science\\n\\nA minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:\\n\\nIntroductory Courses\\n\\nComputer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n\\x7f\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cComputer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming\\n\\nCore Courses\\n\\nComputer Science 237 Computer Organization\\n\\nComputer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis\\n\\nComputer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages\\n\\nComputer Science 361 Theory of Computation\\n\\nElective Courses\\n\\nTwo or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer\\n\\nScience. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective\\n\\nrequirements. Students may petition the department to waive this restriction with good reason.\\n\\nRequired Courses in Mathematics\\n\\nAny Mathematics or Statistics course at the 200-level or higher except for MATH 200\\n\\nRequired Proficiency in Discrete Mathematics\\n\\nStudents must demonstrate proficiency in discrete mathematics by either passing the departmental Discrete Mathematics Proficiency Exam or by\\n\\nearning a grade of C- or better in MATH 200. This requirement must be met by the end of the sophomore year.\\n\\nThe Discrete Mathematics Proficiency Exam may be taken at most twice and cannot be taken beyond the sophomore year. The exam may not be\\n\\nused to fulfill the requirement for a student who has taken the course pass/fail or who has received a letter grade below C- in Math 200.\\n\\nStudents considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134 and to begin satisfying their mathematics\\n\\nrequirements early. Note in particular that the Discrete Mathematics Proficiency requirement is a prerequisite for many advanced courses.\\n\\nOther Notes\\n\\nStudents who take Computer Science 102T, 103, or 104 prior to Fall 2023 may use that course as one of the two electives required for the major\\n\\nin Computer Science.\\xa0 Those classes cannot be counted toward the major if taken in Fall 2023 or later semesters.\\xa0 Computer Science 102T, 103, 104,\\n\\nand 134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.\\n\\nTo be eligible for admission to the major, a student must have completed at least two Computer Science courses, including Computer Science\\n\\n136, as well as fulfilled the Discrete Mathematics Proficiency Requirement by the end of the sophomore year. A Mathematics course at the 200-level\\n\\nor higher (except for MATH 200) must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core courses\\n\\n(Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally have completed at least three out of the four core\\n\\ncourses by the end of the junior year.\\n\\nWe encourage students to be intellectually engaged in our field beyond the formal structure of courses. \\xa0As such, all computer science majors\\n\\nmust attend at least twenty Computer Science colloquia. Juniors and seniors are encouraged to attend at least five during each semester they are\\n\\npresent on campus.\\xa0 Prospective majors in their first and second years are also encouraged to attend. \\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0A student studying away on a program\\n\\napproved by the International Education and Study Away Office will receive four colloquium credits for each semester away, up to a total of eight\\n\\ncredits.\\n\\nWith the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics or statistics courses may be substituted for one Computer Science\\n\\nelective. Appropriate mathematics classes are those numbered 300 or above, and appropriate statistics courses are those numbered 200 or above.\\n\\nOther variations in the required courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in\\n\\nconsultation with the department.\\n\\nLABORATORY FACILITIES\\n\\nThe Computer Science Department maintains five departmental computer laboratories for students taking Computer Science courses, as well as a\\n\\nlab that can be configured for teaching specialized topics such as robotics. The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty\\n\\nresearch in computer science.\\n\\nTHE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE\\n\\nThe degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to students who have demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of\\n\\nstudy extending beyond the requirements of the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will\\n\\nbe: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in research.\\n\\nHonors study is highly recommended for those students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school,\\n\\npursue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in computer science.\\n\\nProspective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cbeginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer\\n\\nScience 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis that is\\n\\njudged acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of written work and often includes a major computer program. All\\n\\nhonors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their research in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.\\n\\nStudents considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission\\n\\nto candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter\\n\\nstudy units of honors work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three honors courses.\\n\\nHighest honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.\\n\\nINTRODUCTORY COURSES\\n\\nThe department offers a choice of introductory courses; Computer Science 102 The Socio-Techno Web, 103 Electronic Textiles, 104 Data Science\\n\\nand Computation for All, and 134 Introduction to Computer Science.\\n\\nComputer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing computer programming skills. These skills are\\n\\nessential to most upper-level courses in the department. As a result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136, are required as a\\n\\nprerequisite to most advanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to take 134\\n\\nearly.\\n\\nThose students interested in learning more about exciting new ideas in computer science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive\\n\\nprogramming skills, should consider Computer Science 102 The Socio-Techno Web, 103 Electronic Textiles, or 104 Data Science and Computation\\n\\nfor All.\\n\\nStudents with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see “Advanced Placement” below).\\n\\nPlease see https://csci.williams.edu/placement-for-introductory-computer-science-classes/ for a more details on selecting among our classes.\\xa0\\n\\nStudents are always welcome to contact a member of the department for guidance in selecting a first course.\\n\\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE 134\\n\\nIntroduction to Computer Science covers fundamental concepts in the design, implementation and testing of computer programs including loops,\\n\\nconditionals, functions, elementary data types and recursion. There is a strong focus on constructing correct, understandable and efficient programs in\\n\\na structured language such as Java or Python.\\n\\nSTUDY ABROAD\\n\\nStudy abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses while abroad should discuss their plans in\\n\\nadvance with the chair of the department or the departmental study away advisor. Students who plan to study away but do not expect to take courses\\n\\ntoward the major should work with the department to create a plan to ensure that they will be able to complete the major. While study abroad is\\n\\ngenerally not an impediment to completing the major, students should be aware that certain computer science courses must be taken in a particular\\n\\nsequence and that not all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students who wish to discuss their plans are invited to meet with any of\\n\\nthe faculty in Computer Science.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nStudents MUST contact departments/programs BEFORE assuming study away credit will be granted toward the major or concentration.\\n\\nCan your department or program typically pre-approve courses for major/concentration credit?\\n\\nYes, in some cases, if appropriate course information is available in advance (e.g. syllabi and/or course descriptions), though students should be\\n\\nsure to contact the department.\\n\\nWhat criteria will typically be used/required to determine whether a student may receive major/concentration credit for a course taken\\n\\nwhile on study away?\\n\\nCourse title and description, and complete syllabus, including readings and assignments.\\n\\nDoes your department/program place restrictions on the number of major/concentration credits that a student might earn through study\\n\\naway?\\n\\nYes. Typically no more than two CSCI courses and one Math course.\\n\\nDoes your department/program place restrictions on the types of courses that can be awarded credit towards your major?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAre there specific major requirements that cannot be fulfilled while on study away?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAre there specific major requirements in your department/program that students should be particularly aware of when weighing study\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0caway options? (Some examples might include a required course that is always taught in one semester, laboratory requirements.)\\n\\nYes. Many CSCI electives are not taught every year. Students should develop a plan to complete all major requirements and discuss them with\\n\\nthe department prior to going abroad.\\n\\nGive examples in which students thought or assumed that courses taken away would count toward the major or concentration and then\\n\\nlearned they wouldn’t:\\n\\nStudents must have courses pre-approved prior to going abroad to ensure they meet the curricular goals and standards of the department.\\n\\nADVANCED PLACEMENT\\n\\nStudents with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement Examination in Computer Science. A\\n\\nscore of 4 or better on the AP Computer Science A exam is normally required for advanced placement in Computer Science 136.\\n\\nStudents who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Placement Examination should consult with the\\n\\ndepartment. Such students should have had a good course in computer science using a structured language such as Java or Python.\\n\\nPLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS\\n\\nThe faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experience by completing a coherent plan of study\\n\\nin one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options\\n\\nin our department’s curriculum ranging from two-course sequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions\\n\\nthat recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such a plan of study are invited to discuss their plans in detail with a member of\\n\\nthe faculty. To assist students making such plans, we include some suggestions below.\\n\\nStudents seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the department are encouraged to use the major\\n\\nrequirements as a guide. In particular, the four core courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of\\n\\ncomputer science. Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses followed by one of our\\n\\nupper-level electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a total of five Computer Science courses in addition to the Discrete\\n\\nMathematics Proficiency requirement.\\n\\nThere are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in programming for use in other areas. For\\n\\ngeneral programming, Computer Science 134 followed by 136 and 256 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure\\n\\ndesign together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take\\n\\nComputer Science 134 at a minimum, and should also consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and\\n\\n134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences.\\n\\nThere are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the department chair or other members of the\\n\\ndepartment’s faculty.\\n\\nGENERAL REMARKS\\n\\nDivisional Requirements\\n\\nAll Computer Science courses may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.\\n\\nAlternate Year Courses\\n\\nComputer Science 102, 103, 104, and our electives are each usually offered at least every other year. All other Computer Science courses are\\n\\nnormally offered every year.\\n\\nCourse Numbering\\n\\nThe increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of maturity in the subject that is expected of\\n\\nstudents. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number\\n\\n(particularly in upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.\\n\\nCourse Descriptions\\n\\nBrief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information on the offerings in the department is\\n\\navailable at http://www.cs.williams.edu/.\\n\\nCourses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis\\n\\nStudents taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students taking the course on a graded\\n\\nbasis.\\n\\nWith the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken pass-fail (with the exception of tutorials), though\\n\\ncourses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or honors requirements. However, with the permission of the\\n\\ndepartment, courses taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCSCI 103  (S)  Electronic Textiles  (QFR) \\n\\nDigital data is being infused throughout the entire physical world, escaping the computer monitor and spreading to other devices and appliances,\\n\\nincluding the human body. Electronic textiles, or eTextiles, is one of the next steps toward making everything interactive and this course aims to\\n\\nintroduce learners to the first steps of developing their own wearable interactive technology devices. After completing a series of introductory eTextiles\\n\\nprojects to gain practice in necessary sewing, circuitry, and programming skills, students will propose and design their own eTextiles projects,\\n\\neventually implementing them with sewable Arduino components, and other found electronic components as needed. The scope of the project will\\n\\ndepend on the individual\\'s prior background, but can include everything from a sweatshirt with light-up turn signals for bicycling, to a wall banner that\\n\\ndisplays the current air quality of the room, to a stuffed animal that plays a tune when the lights go on, to whatever project you can conceivably\\n\\naccomplish with sewable Arduino inputs, outputs, and development board in a semester context. This class will introduce students to introductory\\n\\ncomputer programming, circuitry, and sewing with the goal of creating novel wearable artifacts that interact with the world.   \\n\\nClass Format: interspersed with hands-on activities in a computer lab\\n\\nRequirements/Evaluation:  weekly homework assignments and a final project\\n\\nPrerequisites:  none\\n\\nEnrollment Limit:  18\\n\\nEnrollment Preferences:  students who have not previously taken a CSCI course\\n\\nExpected Class Size:  18\\n\\nGrading:     yes pass/fail option,     yes fifth course option  \\n\\nUnit Notes:  Please see the Computer Science Department website for more information on selecting an introductory computer science class:\\n\\nhttps://csci.williams.edu/\\n\\nMaterials/Lab Fee:  a fee of $95 will be added to term bill to cover Lilypad Arduino components (Protosnap Plus Kit, battery holders, sets of LEDs,\\n\\ntemperature sensor, vibe board, tri-color LED), alligator test leads, fabric, thread & fabric scissors.\\n\\nDistributions:  (D3)  (QFR) \\n\\nQuantative/Formal Reasoning Notes: The course will teach students the basics of computer programming through projects in which\\n\\nquantitative/formal reasoning skills are practiced and evaluated.\\n\\nNot offered current academic year\\n\\nCSCI 104  (F)  Data Science and Computing for All  (QFR) \\n\\nMany of the world\\'s greatest discoveries and most consequential decisions are enabled or informed by the analysis of data from a myriad of sources.\\n\\nIndeed, the ability to wrangle, visualize, and draw conclusions from data is now a critical tool in the sciences, business, medicine, politics, other\\n\\nacademic disciplines, and society as a whole.

Students will learn how to find and critically read research papers,\\n\\nformulate and describe a research problem, propose a solution to that problem, and design an evaluation plan for assessing the effectiveness of the\\n\\nproposed solution. Students will learn about the general research framework through readings, videos, in-class activities, and class discussions.\\n\\nThroughout the course, students will apply those general research methods to a research question in an area of their choice (e.g., machine learning,\\n\\nalgorithms, parallel architecture, etc.), working in groups of up to three students. Each group will create a written research project proposal that\\n\\nincludes a description of the research context and the specific problem to be solved with appropriate related work citations, a description of the\\n\\nproposed solution or approach, and a plan for evaluating the proposed solution. Assessment will be based on a written project proposal and an\\n\\nin-class oral presentation of that proposal.    \\n\\nRequirements/Evaluation:  Short paper and final project or presentation.\\n\\nPrerequisites:  Students should have successfully completed Computer Science 134 or some similar computing experience.\\n\\nEnrollment Limit:  15\\n\\nEnrollment Preferences:  We will select a set of students who have different amounts of computer science experience.\\n\\nExpected Class Size:  NA\\n\\nGrading:     pass/fail only  \\n\\nAttributes:  EXPE Experiential Education Courses  \\n\\nNot offered current academic year\\n\\nCSCI 23  (W)  Research and Development in Computing  \\n\\nAn independent project is completed in collaboration with a member of the Computer Science Department.

To support this endeavor, we will\\n\\nexamine, critique, and apply methodologies intended to solve these problems, including those developed by Marty Cagan, Steve Blank, Don Norman,\\n\\nSteve Krug and Eric Ries. Students will learn to act as effective product managers, achieving alignment between business, technology, and UI/UX\\n\\ndesign. Such alignment is crucial given that technology projects often fail not because of the quality of technical engineering but due to misalignment in\\n\\nthese three areas. Google Glass failed to account for its price tag, fashion, and the privacy panic. The initial Obamacare website failed to address\\n\\nmanagement issues and predict the volume of website visitors. Flexcube failed to update and incorporate users into the design of their product,\\n\\nresulting in a $500 M UX mistake for Citi bank. These organizations did not identify the right problem, or did not build the right solution. The underlying\\n\\nconflict is IT teams like to be told what to build, but users often do not know what they want or how to express it. We will learn how product managers\\n\\nand their interdisciplinary teams can bridge that gap.   \\n\\nRequirements/Evaluation:  final project or presentation\\n\\nPrerequisites:  none\\n\\nEnrollment Limit:  12\\n\\nEnrollment Preferences:  Students are asked to submit a brief letter describing why they are interested in the course and what they hope to get out\\n\\nof it.

Seeking answers to such causal (as opposed to associational) questions is a fundamental human endeavor; the answers we find can be used to support decision-making in various settings such as healthcare and public policy. But how does one tease apart causation from association--early in our statistical education we are taught that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" In this course, we will re-examine this phrase and learn how to reason with confidence about the validity of causal conclusions drawn from messy real-world data. We will cover core topics in causal inference including causal graphical models, unsupervised learning of the structure of these models, expression of causal quantities as functions of observed data, and robust/efficient estimation of these quantities using statistical and machine learning methods. Concepts in the course will be contextualized via regular case studies.',\n",

Indeed, the ability to wrangle, visualize, and draw conclusions from data is now a critical tool in the sciences, business, medicine, politics, other academic disciplines, and society as a whole. This course lays the foundations for quantifying relationships in data by exploring complementary computational, statistical, and visualization concepts. These concepts will be reinforced by lab experiences designed to teach programming and statistics skills while analyzing real-world data sets. This course will also examine the broader context and social issues surrounding data analysis, including privacy and ethics.\",\n",

We organize and transform information in order to solve problems using algorithms written in a modern object-oriented language. Topics include organization of data using objects and classes, and the description of processes using conditional control, iteration, methods and classes. We also begin the study of abstraction, self-reference, reuse, and performance analysis. While the choice of programming language and application area will vary in different offerings, the skills students develop will transfer equally well to more advanced study in many areas. In particular, this course is designed to provide the programming skills needed for further study in computer science and is expected to satisfy introductory programming requirements in other departments.',\n",

It couples work on program design, analysis, and verification with an introduction to the study of data structures. Data structures capture common ways in which to store and manipulate data, and they are important in the construction of sophisticated computer programs. Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Students will be expected to write several programs, ranging from very short programs to more elaborate systems. Emphasis will be placed on the development of clear, modular programs that are easy to read, debug, verify, analyze, and modify.',\n",

We will study several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136.

Additional topics of study include algorithms on graphs and strategies for handling potentially intractable problems.',\n",

Students will learn both how to build their own prototypes and how to send out designs to have parts machined professionally. Students will work in teams throughout. The course will culminate in a team robotic design competition testing both functionality and creativity.',\n",

This course explores topics in supervised learning (e.g., random forests and neural networks), unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means clustering and expectation maximization), and possibly reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning and temporal difference learning.)

But how does one tease apart causation from association--early in our statistical education we are taught that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" In this course, we will re-examine this phrase and learn how to reason with confidence about the validity of causal conclusions drawn from messy real-world data. We will cover core topics in causal inference including causal graphical models, unsupervised learning of the structure of these models, expression of causal quantities as functions of observed data, and robust/efficient estimation of these quantities using statistical and machine learning methods.
